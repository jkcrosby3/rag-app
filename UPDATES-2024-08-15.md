# RAG System Updates - August 15, 2024

## Summary

Today we made significant improvements to the RAG system's user interface and file tracking functionality. The main focus was on creating a more cohesive user experience and cleaning up the project structure.

## Changes Made

### 1. Unified User Interface
- Created `unified_app.py` - A new Streamlit-based interface that combines:
  - Document querying
  - Document management
  - System monitoring
- Features tabbed navigation for easy switching between functions
- Modern, responsive design with improved user experience

### 2. Enhanced Startup System
- Updated `start_web_app.py` with support for multiple UI options:
  - Unified Interface (default)
  - Query Interface (streamlit)
  - Document Management (gradio)
  - Flask Web App (traditional)
- Added command-line arguments for flexible configuration
- Improved error handling and dependency management

### 3. File Tracking System
- Implemented a robust file tracking system with `track_updates.py`
- Created `tracking_service.bat` for managing the tracking service:
  ```batch
  .\tracking_service.bat          # Start the service
  .\tracking_service.bat stop     # Stop the service
  ```
- Removed redundant `run_tracking.bat` as it was superseded by `tracking_service.bat`

### 4. Project Cleanup
- Added `cleanup.bat` to remove temporary files:
  - Python cache files (*.pyc, __pycache__)
  - Build and distribution directories
  - IDE and testing artifacts
  - Temporary files (*.log, *.bak, *~)

## How to Use

### Starting the Application
```batch
# Windows
.\start_web_app.bat

# Linux/MacOS
chmod +x start_web_app.sh
./start_web_app.sh
```

### Managing File Tracking
```batch
# Start tracking service (runs in background)
.\tracking_service.bat

# Stop tracking service
.\tracking_service.bat stop
```

### Cleaning Up
```batch
.\cleanup.bat
```

## Next Steps
1. Test the unified interface with various document types
2. Monitor the file tracking system for any issues
3. Gather user feedback on the new interface
4. Consider adding more advanced document management features

## Notes
- The unified interface is now the default when starting the application
- File tracking runs as a background service and logs changes to timestamped files
- The cleanup script helps maintain a clean project directory
