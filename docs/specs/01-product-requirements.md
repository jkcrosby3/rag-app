# RAG System Product Requirements Document (PRD)

## Executive Summary
A Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) system that enables users to efficiently search and query their document collection through natural language conversations.

### Goals
- Enable natural language querying of document collections
- Provide accurate, source-backed answers
- Streamline document management and search
- Make information retrieval more efficient
- Add support (separate from the chat across all documents) to search for all documents in the collection meeting the user's query.
- Start with a CLI tool proof of concept MVP, then add a web app proof of concept if time permits.

### Success Metrics
- Search response time < 2 seconds
- Answer accuracy > 90% (validated through user feedback)
- Document processing time < 5 minutes per document
- User satisfaction score > 4.5/5
- System uptime > 99.9%
