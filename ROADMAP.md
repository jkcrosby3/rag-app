# RAG Application Development Roadmap

This document outlines future development plans and enhancements for the RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) application.

## CI/CD Implementation

### Automated Testing

1. **Unit Tests**
   - [ ] Test document processing functions
   - [ ] Test embedding generation
   - [ ] Test retrieval mechanisms
   - [ ] Test query processing

2. **Integration Tests**
   - [ ] End-to-end tests of the retrieval process
   - [ ] Tests with sample documents and queries

3. **Performance Tests**
   - [ ] Measure retrieval speed
   - [ ] Evaluate accuracy of results
   - [ ] Monitor memory usage

### Automated Deployment

1. **Environment Setup**
   - [ ] Automate virtual environment creation
   - [ ] Install dependencies from requirements.txt or pyproject.toml

2. **Containerization**
   - [ ] Build Docker images for the application
   - [ ] Push images to a registry (Docker Hub, GitHub Container Registry)

3. **Deployment Options**
   - [ ] Deploy to cloud services (AWS, Azure, GCP)
   - [ ] Deploy to specialized AI/ML platforms
   - [ ] Update documentation sites

## GitHub Actions Workflow Example

```yaml
name: RAG App CI/CD

on:
  push:
    branches: [ main ]
  pull_request:
    branches: [ main ]

jobs:
  test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@v3
    - name: Set up Python
      uses: actions/setup-python@v4
      with:
        python-version: '3.10'
    - name: Install dependencies
      run: |
        python -m pip install --upgrade pip
        if [ -f requirements.txt ]; then pip install -r requirements.txt; fi
        pip install pytest pytest-cov
    - name: Test with pytest
      run: |
        pytest --cov=./ --cov-report=xml
    - name: Upload coverage to Codecov
      uses: codecov/codecov-action@v3

  deploy:
    needs: test
    if: github.event_name == 'push' && github.ref == 'refs/heads/main'
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@v3
    # Add deployment steps here
```

## Additional Enhancements

- [ ] Implement user authentication and authorization
- [ ] Add monitoring and logging
- [ ] Optimize vector database for larger document collections
- [ ] Implement caching for frequent queries
- [ ] Create a user-friendly web interface

## Collaboration Guidelines

- [ ] Set up branch protection rules
- [ ] Establish code review process
- [ ] Create contribution guidelines
- [ ] Document API endpoints
