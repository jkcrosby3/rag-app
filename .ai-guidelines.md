# AI Collaboration Guidelines

This document provides guidelines for AI assistants (like Cascade, GitHub Copilot, etc.) when contributing to this project.

## Project Context

- This is a RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) application that combines:
  - Jupyter notebooks for prototyping and demonstration
  - Python CLI for command-line operations
  - Web interface for user interactions
- Target Python version: 3.13+

## Development Guidelines

### Code Style

- Follow PEP 8 conventions
- Use type hints for all function parameters and return values
- Prefer explicit over implicit
- Use descriptive variable names that reflect their purpose

### Architecture

- Keep core RAG functionality separate from CLI/Web interfaces
- Use dependency injection for better testability
- Follow SOLID principles
- Implement proper error handling and logging

### Testing

- Write unit tests for all new functionality
- Include doctest examples in docstrings
- Maintain high test coverage
- Test both success and error cases

### Documentation

- All modules, classes, and functions must have docstrings
- Include usage examples in docstrings
- Keep README.md updated with new features
- Document any non-obvious design decisions

### Security

- Never include API keys or secrets in code
- Use environment variables for configuration
- Validate all user inputs
- Handle errors gracefully without exposing internal details

### Performance

- Consider memory usage when handling large documents
- Implement proper caching strategies
- Profile code for bottlenecks
- Use async operations where appropriate

## AI Assistant Instructions

1. Always explain significant design decisions
2. Suggest optimizations when you spot potential improvements
3. Point out potential security issues
4. Help maintain consistent documentation
5. Propose tests for new functionality
6. Flag any deviations from these guidelines
