  "text": "entionalaggregate demand stimulus could not have mattered in the recovery from theGreat Depression. Bernanke and Parkinson [1989] analyze the apparent trendreversion of employment in the 1930s and are struck by the strength of therecovery. They believe, however, that \"the New Deal is better characterizedas having 'cleared the way' for a natural recovery ... ratherthan as being\n\n3the engine of recovery itself\" (1989, p. 212). As a result, they argue thatthe trend reversion of the interwar economy is evidence of a strong self\u2014corrective force. De Long andSummers (1988) sound a similar theme. Theystate that \"thesubstantialdegree of mean reversion by 1941 is evidence thatshocks to output are transitory.\" The only aggregate demand policy that theythink might have contributed to the recovery was World War II, and theyconclude that \"it is hard to attribute any of the pre\u20141942 catch\u2014up of the\neconomy to the war\" [1988, p. 467].\nB.",
