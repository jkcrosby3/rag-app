The one obvious area of excess was the stock market. \nStock prices had risen more than fourfold from the low in 1921 to the peak reached in 1929. In \n1928 and 1929, the Federal Reserve had raised interest rates in hopes of slowing the rapid rise in stock prices. These higher interest rates depressed interest-sensitive spending in areas such as \nconstruction and automobile purchases, which in turn reduced production.
