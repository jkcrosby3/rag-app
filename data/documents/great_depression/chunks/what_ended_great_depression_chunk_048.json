  "text": "fects of an expansionary aggregate demand shockon the level of real output to be undone eventually. I do this because theconstraint that the long\u2014run effects of policy are zero is simply imposed apriori in most models; what evidence there is in fact indicates that the realeffects of policy shifts are highly persistent (see, for example, Romer andRosier [1989]).However, provided that one does not assume that the positive effects ofexpansionary policy are undone very quickly (that is, within a year or two),allowing for negative feedback effects from a policy stimulus would not negatethe crucial role of policy in generating the high real growth rates observedin the mid\u2014 and late\u20141930s. This is true both because in the first few yearsof the expansion there would be no negative feedback effects from previouspolicy expansions and because there are progressively larger monetary growthrates toward the end of the recovery.",
