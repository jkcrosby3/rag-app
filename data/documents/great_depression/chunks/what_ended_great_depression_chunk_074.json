  "text": "inding of this study is that monetary developments were acrucial source of the recovery of the U.S. economy from the Great Depression.The very rapid growth of the money supply beginning in 1933 appears to havelowered real interest rates and stimulated investment spending just asconventional models of the transmission mechanism would predict.These expansionary monetary developments were almost surely independent,in the sense that the money supply increased for reasons unrelated to thegrowth of real output. However, whether the expansion should be attributed togood luck or good policy is more debatable. The money supply grew rapidly inthe mid\u2014 and late\u20141930s primarily because huge gold inflows to the U.S. wentunsterilized. While the later gold flows were mainly due to political\ndevelopments in Europe, the largest gold inflows occurred immediatelyfollowing the revaluation of gold mandated by the Roosevelt administration in1934.",
