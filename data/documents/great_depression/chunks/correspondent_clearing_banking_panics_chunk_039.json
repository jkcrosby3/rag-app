Consider, for example, the case of a check sent by a textile factory in New \nEngland drawn on a Lowell bank with a Boston correspondent to a cotton-farmer in Alabama \nwho deposited the check in his local bank with a Birmingham correspondent which routed the \ncheck through its New York correspondent on the way back to New England. At its peak, the \nvalue of the check would be added to the reserve account of the four banks through which it \ntraveled: the local Alabama bank, its Birmingham correspondent, its New York correspondent, \nand the Boston correspondent.",
