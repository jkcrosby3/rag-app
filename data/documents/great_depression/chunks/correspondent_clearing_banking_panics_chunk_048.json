The Fed cleared \nchecks both within and across districts. Each day, Federal Reserve members submitted the \nchecks that they received to the nearest Federal Reserve office. The Fed office routed the checks \ndirectly to banks within its district and to the pertinent Federal Reserve district office for banks \nbelonging to other districts. The Federal Reserve also accepted checks from non-member banks \non the par list, which included about 90% of the banks in the nation. Banks on the par list paid at \nface value checks sent to them by the Federal Reserve. Most did so voluntarily, and in exchange, \nthe Federal Reserve covered the costs of their efforts by supplying the necessary forms and pre-\nprinted and pre-posted envelopes.",
