  "text": "enues\nto the Treasury.73\nThis explanation of Federal Reserve policy\nprovokes a number of questions. Left unclear,\nfor example, is why member banks had more\ninfluence over Congress than nonmember banks.\nNor is it explained how the Fed was able to af-\nfect the fortunes of nonmember banks in partic-ular states with the tools at its disposal. The Fed\ncannot control the destination of reserve flows\ngenerated by open market operations, and the\ndiscount window was not open to nonmember\nbanks. Perhaps Fed officials could have selec-\ntively restricted credit to member banks that\nlent to nonmember banks in particular states,\nbut it is doubtful that such a circuitous route\nwould have had a large impact on losses.\nHuberman (1990) casts further doubt on the\nAnderson, Shughart and Tollison (1988) view.\nHe notes that, although 75 percent of banks\nthat suspended during the Depression were\nnonmember banks, the ratio of nonmember to\nmember bank suspensions from 1930 to 1933\nwas lower than it had been",
