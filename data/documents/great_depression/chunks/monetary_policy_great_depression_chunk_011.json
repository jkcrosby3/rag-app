  "text": "d on government relief projects as\nunemployed. Kesselman and Savin (1978) offer an oppos-\ning view. Regardless of which argument is accepted, un-\nemployment during the 1930s was exceptionally severe,\nparticularly since there were relatively few multi-income\nhouseholds.\n5There was no deposit insurance in these years. The Bank-\ning Act of 1933 created federal deposit insurance. During\nthe 19th and early 20th centuries a number of states ex-\nperimented with insurance plans for their state-chartered\nbanks, but none was still in existence by 1930. See\nCalomiris (1989) for a survey of the state systems.\nFEDERAL RESERVE BANK OF ST.
