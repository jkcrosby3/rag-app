In 1938 the economy sufferedanother 5 percent fall in real CUP, but this was followed by an even more\n\n6spectacular rise in real CNP of 49 percent between 1938 and 1942. Clearly, byalmost any standard, the growth of real GNP in the four\u2014year periods beforeand after 1938 was spectacular.On the other hand, it is also the case that despite this rapid growth,output remained substantially below normal until about 1942. A simple way toestimate trend output for the 1930s is to extrapolate the average annualgrowth rate of real GNP over the period 1923\u20141927 forward from 1927. Theperiod 1923\u20141927 is chosen for estimating normal growth because these are thefour most normal years of the 1920s: this period excludes the recession andrecovery of the early 1920s and the boom of the late 1920s.",
