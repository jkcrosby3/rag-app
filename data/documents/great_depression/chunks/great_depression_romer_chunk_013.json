  "text": "red in the fall of 1930, when the first of four \nwaves of banking panics gripped the United States. A banking panic arises when many depositors lose confidence in the solvency of banks and simultaneously demand their deposits be \npaid to them in cash. Banks, which typically hold only a fraction of deposits as cash reserves, \nmust liquidate loans in order to raise the required cash. This process of hasty liquidation can cause even a previously solvent bank to fail. The United States experienced widespread banking \npanics in the fall of 1930, the spring of 1931, the fall of 1931, and the fall of 1932. The final \nwave of panics continued through the winter of 1933 and culminated with the national \u201cbank holiday\u201d declared by President Franklin Roosevelt on March 6, 1933. The bank holiday closed \nall banks, permitting them to reopen only after being deemed solvent by government inspectors. \nThe panics took a severe toll on the American banking system.",
