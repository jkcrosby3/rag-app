Smithies asserts that \"fiscalpo icy did prove to be an effective and indeed the only effective means torecovery\" though his conclusion seems to be more the result of faith than ofevidence [1946, p. 12). Hansen, on the other hand, argues that fiscal policywas not used extensively in the 1930s [1941, p. 84). Brown uses aconventional Keynesian multiplier model and the concept of discretionarygovernment spending to support Hansen's view. His often\u2014cited conclusion isthat \"fiscal policy, then, seems to have been an unsuccessful recovery devicein the 'thirties \u2014notbecause it did not work, but because it was not tried\"\n[1956, pp. 863\u2014866).Friedman and Schwartz [1963) stress that Federal Reserve policy was notthe source of the recovery from the Depression either.",
