  "text": "Most System transactions involve member\ncommercial banks and directly affect member\nbank reserves. If the Fed makes an open\nmarket purchase of government securities\nfrom a member bank, for example, it pays\nfor the securities by crediting the member\nbank's deposit with the Federal Reserve.\nSince a deposit at the Fed is the principal\nform in which banks hold their legal\nreserves,3 an open market purchase adds\ndirectly to bank reserves.4\nMany Federal Reserve transactions are in-\nitiated by commercial banks. When the Unit-\ned States was on the gold standard, the Fed\nheld substantial gold reserves, and transac-\ntions in gold were common. For example,\nsuppose gold coin was deposited by a cus-\ntomer of a member bank. The bank could\nsend the coin to its Federal Reserve Bank and\nreceive an increase in its reserve deposit of\nthat amount. The Fed's gold reserves and\nmember bank deposits would increase by the\nsame amount.",
