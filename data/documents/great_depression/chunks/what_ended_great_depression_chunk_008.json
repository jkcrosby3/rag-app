  "text": "\"it is hard to attribute any of the pre\u20141942 catch\u2014up of the\neconomy to the war\" [1988, p. 467].\nB. OverviewDespitethis conventional wisdom, there is reason to suspect that\naggregate demand developments, particularly monetary changes, were importantin fostering the recovery from the Great Depression. This reason is thesimple but often neglected fact that Ml grew at an average rate of nearly 10percent per year between 1933 and 1937, and at an even higher rate in theearly 1940s. Such large and persistent rates of money growth wereunprecedented in U.S. economic history and thus would seem to provide apossible explanation for the unprecedented growth of real output in the mid\u2014and late\u20141930s.To quantify the importance of these monetary changes and other aggregatedemand stimuli in ending the Depression, I perform a simple \"back\u2014of\u2014the\u2014envelope\" calculation.",
