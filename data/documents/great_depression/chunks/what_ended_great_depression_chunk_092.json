  "text": "of what might happen if one took into accountthe positive supply shock in 1921 discussed in note 4. This is true becausenetting out the effect of the supply shock would tend to increase the roleassigned to the large increase in the surplus to CM? ratio that occurred in1920 and therefore decrease the role assigned to monetary policy.11. Any change in the fiscal policy multiplier that increases the role offiscal policy may alter the narrow finding of this paper that fiscal policywas unimportant, but it will strengthen the more general point that aggregatedemand stimulus was important to the recovery.12. These multipliers are reported in a recent report of the Federal ReserveBoard (1987, Tables 1 and 2). The monetary policy shock used in the MI'Ssimulation is a permanent increase in the level of Ml of 1 percent over theprojected baseline. This is equivalent to the shock I consider in mysimulations, which is a one\u2014time deviation in the growth rate of Ml from itsnormal growth rate.",
