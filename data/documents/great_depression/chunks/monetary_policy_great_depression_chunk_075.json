  "text": "er, the pur-\nchases in 1924 were intended to encourage the\nflow of gold to Britain by reducing U.S. interest\nrates relative to those in London, with the goal\nof assisting Britain's return to the gold standard.\nThe 1927 purchases were intended to help Bri-\ntain through a payments crisis, again by direct-\ning capital toward London; these purchases\nfollowed closely a meeting between Strong and\nEuropean central bank heads.\nChandler (1958), p. 199, argues that both\ndomestic and international goals were important\nin 1924 and 1927, and Wheelock (1991), ch. 2,\nfinds empirical support for this view. Wheelock\nalso shows that, relative to the decline in eco-\nnomic activity, the Fed made substantially fewer\nopen market purchases in 1930 and 1931 than\nit did during 1924 and 1927. This might reflect\na significant change in System behavior between\nthe 1920s and early 1930s.",
