  "text": "a slipped into depression in late 1928 and \nearly 1929, slightly before the U.S. decline in output. While some less developed countries \nexperienced severe depressions, others, such as Argentina and Brazil, experienced comparatively mild downturns. The depression in Japan started relatively late (in early 1930) and was, by \ncomparison, mild. \nThe general price deflation evident in the United States was also present in other \ncountries. Virtually every industrialized country endured declines in wholesale prices of 30 \npercent or more between 1929 and 1933. Because of the greater flexibility of the Japanese price \nstructure, deflation in Japan was unusually rapid in 1930 and 1931. This rapid deflation may have helped to keep the decline in Japanese production relatively mild. The prices of primary \ncommodities traded in world markets declined even more dramatically during this period.",
