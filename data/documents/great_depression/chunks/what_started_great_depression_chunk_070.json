  "text": "t the workweek in manufacturing is exogenously\n\fxed at its actual sequence between 1929:4 - 1931:4. Hoover's worksharing\nmandate is almost certainly the reason why the workweek declined so much\nduring the Depression.9As discussed above, before Hoover's intervention,\nthe workweek length varied little over the cycle, as changes in employment,\nrather than changes in hours per worker, accounted for most of the cyclical\nchange in manufacturing hours. For example, following the World War I\n9Hoover intended his worksharing program to be a form of insurance against job loss.\nHowever,recall that there was very little worksharing prior to Hoover's program. Presum-\nably, worksharing was always possible, and the fact that \frms and workers did not choose\nthis option suggests that the bene\ft exceeded its cost.\n35",
