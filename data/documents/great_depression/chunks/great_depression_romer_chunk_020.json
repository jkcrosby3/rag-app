This took place because deflation in the \nUnited States made American goods particularly desirable to foreigners, while low income \nreduced American demand for foreign products. To counteract the resulting tendency toward an American trade surplus and foreign gold outflows, central banks throughout the world raised \ninterest rates. Maintaining the international gold standard, in essence, required a massive \nmonetary contraction throughout the world to match the one occurring in the United States.",
