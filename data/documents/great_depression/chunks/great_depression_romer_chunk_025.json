  "text": "States, which did not effectively \ndevalue its currency until 1933, recovered substantially later. Similarly, the Latin American \ncountries of Argentina and Brazil, which began to devalue in 1929, had relatively mild downturns and were largely recovered by 1935. In contrast, the \u201cGold Bloc\u201d countries of \nBelgium and France, which were particularly wedded to the gold standard and slow to devalue, \nstill had industrial production in 1935 well below its 1929 level. \nDevaluation, however, did not increase output directly. Rather, it allowed countries to \nexpand their money supplies without concern about gold movements and exchange rates. \nCountries that took greater advantage of this freedom saw greater recovery. The monetary expansion that began in the United States in early 1933 was particularly dramatic. The American \nmoney supply increased nearly 42 percent between 1933 and 1937.",
