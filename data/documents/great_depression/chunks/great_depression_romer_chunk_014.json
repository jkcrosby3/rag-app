By 1933, one-fifth of the banks in existence at the start of 1930 had failed. \nBy their nature, banking panics are largely irrational, inexplicable events, but some of the \nfactors contributing to the problem can be explained.

The \nheavy farm debt stemmed in part from the response to the high prices of agricultural goods \nduring World War I. American farmers borrowed heavily to purchase and improve land in order to increase production. The decline in farm commodity prices following the war made it difficult \nfor farmers to keep up with their loan payments. \nThe Federal Reserve did little to try to stem the banking panics.
