  "text": "cturing wages rose during\nthe Depression. Figure 3 shows the nominal manufacturing wage, and the\n6\n\nreal manufacturing wage.1Real wages rise modestly at the start of the De-\npression, and continue to rise as the Depression deepens. The \fgure shows\nthat for much of this period, higher real wages are the consequence of roughly\nconstant nominal wages and de\nation. The industrial labor market distor-\ntion is suggested by the fact that higher real wages coincide with substantial\nemployment loss. In sharp contrast, real wages fall considerably in agricul-\nture. The real agricultural wage, which is the daily farm wage rate relative\nto the CPI, declines by about 25 percent between 1929 and 1931.",
