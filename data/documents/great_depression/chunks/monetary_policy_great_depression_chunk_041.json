First, beginning in the early\n1920s, the System offset or \"sterilized\" gold\nflows and other changes in reserve funds by al-\ntering the volume of Fed credit outstanding.30\nThis policy limited fluctuations in bank reserves\nand, thus, in the money supply and price level.\nAccording to Friedman and Schwartz (1963), pp.\n394-99, however, the Fed permitted gold out-\nflows during the Depression to reduce bank\nreserves and the money supply and more than\noffset gold inflows.",
