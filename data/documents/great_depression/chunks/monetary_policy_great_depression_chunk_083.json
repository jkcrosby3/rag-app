  "text": "30-31 downturns. The\nFed's index of industrial production indicates\nthe severity of each recession. Following the\nstock market crash in October 1929, the New\nYork Fed purchased $160 million of government\nsecurities and, by the end of December, the Sys-\ntem had purchased an additional $150 million.\nBut, from January 1930 to October 1931, the\nFed made only modest purchases, particularly in\ncomparison with those made in 1924 and 1927,\nwhen the declines in economic activity were\nless.\nThe relatively small purchases in 1930 and\n1931 appear consistent, however, with the use\nof member bank borrowing as a policy guide.\nThis, according to Brunner and Meltzer (1968),\nexplains the Fed's failure to respond aggressive-\nly to the Depression.58 Member bank borrowing\nfell substantially following the stock market\ncrash in October 1929 and averaged just $241\nmillion from January 1930 to August 1931. Bor-\nrowing by reporting member banks in New\nYork City averaged just $8 million over the\nsame months.",
