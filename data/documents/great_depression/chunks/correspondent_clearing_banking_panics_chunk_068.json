It does not seem surprising that this \nevent, the worst chain reaction in United States financial history, marked the onset of the worst \nperiod of bank distress and most catastrophic financial contraction in United States financial \nhistory.

Figure 4 uses the shading scheme of Figure 2 \nto portray the cause of suspensions during the fall of 1930 and winter of 1931, a period which \nwitnessed the initial surge of bank suspensions during the Great Depression.
