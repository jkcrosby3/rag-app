  "text": "to the recovery from the Great Depression.Had money growth been held to its normal level, the U.S. economy in 1942 wouldhave been 50 percent below its pre\u2014Depression trend path, rather than back to\nnormal output.9The source of this large estimated effect of monetary developments isnot hard to find. As described above, the monetary policy multiplierestimated from 1921 and 1938 is of roughly the magnitude that is found inpostwar macromodels. Therefore, the large estimated effect of monetarydevelopments is not due to an implausibly large multiplier for monetarypolicy. Rather the large estimated effects are due to the extraordinary ratesof money growth in the mid\u2014 and late\u20141930s. The monetary policy variable(lagged one year) is graphed in Figure 6. As can be seen, the deviations ofthe money growth rate from normal were enormous in the mid\u2014 and late\u20141930s.For most years this deviation was over 10 percent.",
