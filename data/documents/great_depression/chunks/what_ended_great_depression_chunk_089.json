  "text": "iven that this paper seeks to identify the contribution of aggregate demand policy to the recovery. Changes in nominal money are what shift theaggregate demand function; changes in real money result from the interactionof aggregate demand and aggregate supply movements. Thus, to isolate the effects of aggregate demand stimulus, one wants to use a measure of monetarypolicy that only reflects changes in demand.7. The surplus data are from the Department of the Treasury (1979, Table 2, pp. 4\u201411] and are based on the administrative budget. Because these data are for fiscal years, I convert them to a calendar year basis by averaging the observations for a given year and the subsequent year. The data are deflated using the implicit price deflator for CNP. The deflator series and the real GNP series for 1929\u20141942 are from the National Income and Product Accounts",
