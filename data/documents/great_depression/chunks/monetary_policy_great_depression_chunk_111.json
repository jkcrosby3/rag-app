  "text": "val of open market sales,\nthey were able to prevent significant open mar-\nket purchases until 1932. It is likely that the\nFed would not have made large purchases even\nthen without pressure from major bankers and\nCongress.\nThe most important explanations of Federal\nReserve behavior during the Depression,\nhowever, appear to be the dedication of\npolicymakers to preserving the gold standard\nand their attachment to policy guides that gave\nerroneous information about monetary condi-\ntions. Benjamin Strong's death robbed the Sys-\ntem of an intelligent leader at a crucial time and\nundoubtedly imparted a contractionary bias to\nmonetary policy during the Depression. It seems\nclear, however, that Strong's death did not\ncause a fundamental change in regime. Strong\nbelieved in the gold standard, and he would not\nlikely have done anything to jeopardize gold\nconvertibility of the dollar.",
