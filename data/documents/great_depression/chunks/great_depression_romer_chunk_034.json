  "text": "heory \nsuggested that increases in government spending, tax cuts, and monetary expansion could be \n\nused to counteract depressions. This insight, combined with a growing consensus that \ngovernment should try to stabilize employment, has led to much more activist policy since the \n1930s. Legislatures and central banks throughout the world now routinely attempt to prevent or \nmoderate recessions. Whether such a change would have occurred without the Depression is again a largely unanswerable question. What is clear is that this change has made it unlikely that \na decline in spending will ever be allowed to multiply and spread throughout the world as it did \nduring the Great Depression of the 1930s.",
