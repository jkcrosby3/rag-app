Many commercial loans, which often were\ncalled \"bills,\" were made on a discount basis; hence,\nwhen they were endorsed by a bank and sent to a\nReserve Bank in exchange for reserve balances, they\nwere \"re-discounted\" by the Reserve Bank at the\nprevailing discount rate. Alternatively, bills were used\nas collateral for direct advances to member banks,\nhence the term \"bills discounted.\"\n2The terminology is confusing because \"bills\" in this\ncase refer to bankers acceptances, not to the promisso-\nry notes that member banks used as collateral for dis-\ncount loans.\n3From 1917 to 1960, such deposits were the only form\nin which member banks were permitted to hold their le-gal reserves.",
