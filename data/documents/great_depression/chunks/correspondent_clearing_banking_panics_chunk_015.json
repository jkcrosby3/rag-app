Three such check clearing \n\n 5 systems operated in the United States at the onset of the Great Depression. \nThe first system consisted of clearing houses. A clearing house was an association \ncreated by banks doing business in one locality to provide a uniform and convenient method of \nexchanging checks and settling balances on a daily basis. The association was governed by a \nconstitution and a set of regulations adjudicated by an elected committee. Membership was \nvoluntary. A bank joined a clearing house by depositing with the organization either cash or \nsecurities at a fixed ratio either to their capital stock or their deposits. In return, the bank received \ncertificates issued by the organization and used to pay daily balances due to other banks \nbelonging to the association.",
