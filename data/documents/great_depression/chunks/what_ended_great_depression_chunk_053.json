  "text": "clear thatany rise observed in Ml must have been due to a rise in the stock of high\u2014powered money. And indeed, the stock of high\u2014powered money rose substantiallymore than the stock of Ml. It is theoretically possible that this rise in\nhigh\u2014powered money was endogenous, occurring because the monetary authorityincreased the money supply to accommodate the higher transactions demandcaused by higher output. In truth, however, Federal Reserve monetary policywas far from accommodating. Essentially none of the increases in the stock ofhigh\u2014powered money during the second half of the Great Depression were due toactive Federal Reserve policy. The Federal Reserve maintained a policy ofcaution throughout the recovery and even stopped increasing Federal Reservecredit to meet seasonal demands in the mid\u2014 and late\u20141930s (see Friedman andSchwartz [1963, pp. 511\u2014514]).",
