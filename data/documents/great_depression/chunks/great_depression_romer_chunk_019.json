  "text": "nd the Unites States \nwould have been forced to abandon the gold standard along with Great Britain. \nWhile there is debate about the role the gold standard played in limiting U.S. monetary \npolicy, there is no question that it was a key factor in the transmission of the American decline to \nthe rest of the world. Under the gold standard, imbalances in trade or asset flows gave rise to \n\ninternational gold flows. For example, in the mid-1920s intense international demand for \nAmerican assets such as stocks and bonds brought large inflows of gold to the United States. \nLikewise, a decision by France after World War I to return to the gold standard with an \nundervalued franc led to trade surpluses and substantial gold inflows. ( \u03a4 balance of trade.) \nBritain chose to return to the gold standard after World War I at the prewar parity. \nWartime inflation, however, implied that the pound was overvalued, and this overvaluation led to \ntrade deficits and substantial gold outflows after 1925.",
