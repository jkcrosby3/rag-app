  "text": "ence and the stock market bubble \nburst. Panic selling began on \u201cBlack Thursday,\u201d October 24, 1929. Many stocks had been \npurchased on margin, that is, using loans secured by only a small fraction of the stocks\u2019 value. As a result, the price declines forced some investors to liquidate their holdings, thus exacerbating \nthe fall in prices. Between their peak in September and their low in November, U.S. stock prices \n(measured using the Cowles Index) declined 33 percent. Because the decline was so dramatic, this event is often referred to as the Great Crash of 1929. \nThe stock market crash reduced American aggregate demand substantially. Consumer \npurchases of durable goods and business investment fell sharply after the crash. A likely explanation is that the financial crisis generated considerable uncertainty about future income, \nwhich in turn led consumers and firms to put off purchases of durable goods.",
