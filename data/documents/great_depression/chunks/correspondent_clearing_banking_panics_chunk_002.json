The Federal Reserve cleared checks for members\nof the system. Clearing houses cleared checks for members of their organizations. Correspondents\ncleared checks for all other institutions. The correspondent-clearing system was vulnerable to counter-party\ncascades, particularly because accounting conventions overstated reserves available to individual institutions\nand the system as a whole. In November 1930, a correspondent system in the center of the United\nStates collapsed, causing the closure of more than one hundred institutions.",
