These simple policy multipliers can then be\n\n4used to estimate the effects of expansionary monetary and fiscal developmentsin the period 1933\u20141937 and 1939\u20141942.\nSuch simulations suggest that monetary changes were crucially importantto the recovery, while fiscal policy had very little effect. According to thecalculations, real GNP would have been approximately 25 percent lower in 1937and nearly 50 percent lower in 1942 than it actually was had the money supplycontinued to grow at its historical average rate. I also find thatcalculations based on policy multipliers from a large macromodel yield similarconclusions.\nTo see if this huge estimated effect of monetary developments during therecovery phase of the Great Depression is sensible, I then look more closelyat the source of the monetary expansion in the mid\u2014 and late\u20141930s and at thepossible transmission mechanism for monetary developments.",
