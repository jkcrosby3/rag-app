  "text": "1942, the year that the economy returned to its trend path, theeffects of fiscal policy were small. As a result, it is hard to argue thatthe changes in government spending caused by the war were a major factor inthe recovery; the recovery was nearly complete before the war had a noticeable\nfiscal impact.However, Bloomfield's and Friedman and Schwartz's analysis of the causeof the gold inflows that raised the U.S. money supply actually suggest adirect link from the war to the money supply. The U.S. money supply startedto rise in 1938 because of capital flight from Europe caused by Hitler's\nincreasing belligerence; the resulting gold inflows increased dramaticallyafter war was officially declared in Europe. In this way the war may have\nbeen quite important in keeping the U.S. money supply growing rapidly after1938. This could obviously have contributed substantially to the recovery asearly as 1939.",
