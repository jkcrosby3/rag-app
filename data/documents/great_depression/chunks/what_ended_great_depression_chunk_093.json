I use the MPS multiplier derived from the full\u2014modelresponse (Case 3 of Table 2). The fiscal shock used in the MPS simulation isa permanent increase in the purchases of the federal government by 1 percentof real GM? over the baseline projection. This differs from the shock Iconsider, which is a change in the surplus to CNP ratio, because tax revenueswill rise in response to the induced increase in GNP. To make the MI'Smultiplier consistent with my measure of fiscal policy, I assume that themarginal tax rate is 0.3 and then calculate the change in the surplus to CNPratio that corresponds to a 1 percent increase in federal purchases. The MI'Smultiplier that I adjust in this way is based on the full\u2014model response, withMl fixed (Case 4 of Table 1).",
