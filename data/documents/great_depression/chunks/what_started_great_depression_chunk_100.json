  "text": ". In this paper,\nthe distortion is not unionization density per se, but rather a broader change\n50\n\nin labor market policies, including Hoover's program that o\u000bered protection\nagainst possible unionization.\nI am also unaware of other theories of nominal wage maintenance that\nare consistent with the evidence presented here about Hoover and industry's\nmaintenance of nominal wages. O'Brien [18] is perhaps the best known anal-\nysis of nominal wage rigidity during the Depression. He argues that industry\nmaintained nominal wage levels, despite their impact on pro\fts, simply be-\ncause \frms viewed this action as being in their self interest for boundedly\nrational reasons. But O'Brien's view is inconsistent with these data, which\nindicate that \frms did not prefer to maintain high nominal wages, but rather\ndid this only because of Hoover's program.",
