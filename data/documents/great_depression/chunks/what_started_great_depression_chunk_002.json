Ohanian\nNBER Working Paper No. 15258\nAugust 2009, Revised September 2009\nJEL No. E3,N1\nABSTRACT\nHerbert Hoover. I develop a theory of labor market failure for the Depression based on Hoover's industrial\nlabor program that provided industry with protection from unions in return for keeping nominal wages\nfixed. I find that the theory accounts for much of the depth of the Depression and for the asymmetry\nof the depression across sectors.",
