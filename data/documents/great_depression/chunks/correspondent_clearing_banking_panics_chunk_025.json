In the central reserve city of Chicago, 142 of 240 banks belonged to the \nclearing house. In the central reserve city of New York, only 34 of 222 banks belonged to the \nclearing house. \nTable 2 examines the distribution and characteristics of clearing houses with official \nexamination bureaus. The preponderance of these bureaus existed in cities possessing a Federal \nReserve district or branch bank. These cities were, of course, hubs of the financial industry. The \nbanks within them often served as correspondents for country banks in the vicinity. \nThe second check clearing system consisted of correspondent banks. Correspondents \nwere banks with ongoing relationships facilitated by deposits of funds.",
