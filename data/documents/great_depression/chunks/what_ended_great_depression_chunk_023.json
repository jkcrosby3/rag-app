  "text": "In 1937 not only wasthis surge removed, but social security taxes were collected for the firsttime. This increase in revenues in 1937 is clearly unrelated to developmentsin the real economy; itreflectsa conscious decision to permanently raisetaxes to finance a pension system. The result of these two changes was thatthe surplus to GNP ratio rose from \u20144.4 percent in 1936 to \u20142.2 percent in1937.\n\n10The monetary changes in 1937 were less straightforward than those in1920, but still largely independent. Friedman and Schwartz view the mainmonetary shock as the result of the doubling of reserve requirements in threesteps between July 1936 and May 1937 [1963, pp. 543\u20145451. The Federal Reserveraised reserve requirements because they were concerned about the high levelof excess reserves in 1936 and wanted to turn excess reserves into requiredreserves. According to Friedman and Schwartz, this action greatly decreasedthe money supply because banks wanted to hold excess reserves.",
