  "text": "on of the Depression\nrequires a theory of a very large and very protracted monetary nonneutral-\n48\n\nity. Such a theory has been elusive because the Depression is so much larger\nthan any other downturn, and because explaining the persistence of such a\nlarge nonneutrality requires in turn a theory for why the normal economic\nforces that ultimately undo monetary nonneutrality were grossly absent in\nthis episode. That is, if the Depression is largely the result of monetary\nforces, then the size and the duration of the monetary nonneutrality were\nremarkably well outside estimates from any other period.\nThis paper provides such a theory for a large and protracted monetary\nnonneutrality. The nonneutrality is quantitatively large in the Hoover econ-\nomy because Hoover's wage maintenance and work-sharing program reduces\nsteady state hours and capital stocks.",
