Substituting in actual measures of the change in realoutput and the changes in the monetary and fiscal stances for both 1921 and1938 (the calculation of which is described in detail below) yields two\n\n8equations In two unknowns. One can then solve this system for the monetaryand fiscal policy multipliers.To believe that 1921 and 1938 are times that provide good evidence onthe effects of policy, it is important to show that the policy changes werenot responses to movements in real output occurring for other reasons. If themonetary and fiscal changes occurred in response to declines in real output,the procedures would yield excessively large estimates of the effects ofpolicy.2 It must also be the case that there are no additional factors thataccount for the severe recessions that followed the shifts in policy.",
