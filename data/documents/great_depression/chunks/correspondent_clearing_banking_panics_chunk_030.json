  "text": "Chicago. Table 1 indicates the interstate distribution of reserve cities and shows that in 1930, \n\n 10 almost all reserve cities contained clearing houses. State regulations conformed to this \nnationwide pyramiding of reserves, although in some states, state-chartered banks could hold \nreserves in designated banks within their state as well as reserve cities in other jurisdictions. \nOn the eve of the Great Depression, correspondent networks formed a complex web of \nlong-term interbank relationships anchored by banks in large commercial centers. A country \nbank often had a correspondent located in a nearby town, which was a member of the Federal \nReserve, and therefore, could conveniently supply it with cash and clear many of its checks. A \ncountry bank also often possessed at least one correspondent in a financial center. The choice of \ncorrespondent depended on the needs of the respondent bank and its depositors.",
