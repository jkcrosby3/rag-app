  "text": "policy multiplier.10 This change represents avery extreme change in the monetary policy multiplier. Nevertheless, thisreduction in the multiplier only implies that in 1942 real GNP would have beenroughly 25 percent lower than it actually was had monetary policy been held toits usual level during the mid\u2014 and late\u20141930s. This result still suggeststhat aggregate demand stimulus in the forii of monetary policy was crucial tothe recovery. In the case of fiscal policy, doubling the policy multiplierwould lead to the conclusion that real GNP in 1942 would have been 3 percentlower in 1942 had the change in the surplus to GNP ratio been held to zero.This increases the apparent role of fiscal policy, but not dramatically so.11Another way to evaluate the robustness of the calculations is to usepolicy multipliers derived from the estimation of a postwar macromodel.",
