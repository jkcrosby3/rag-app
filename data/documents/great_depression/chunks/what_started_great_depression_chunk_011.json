  "text": "cally, industrial\nhours and output rise until Fall, 1929, but decline rapidly afterwards. Hours\n5\n\nand output fall 20 percent by June, 1930, and by roughly 40 percent by Fall,\n1931. Figure 2 decomposes manufacturing hours into changes in employment\nand changes in the length of the workweek, as both decline signi\fcantly.\nEmployment declines by about 30 percent over this interval and the workweek\ndeclines by about 20 percent.\nNote that these data paint a very di\u000berent picture from the standard\nview that the Great Depression was initially a \"garden variety recession\"\n(see Eichengreen and Bordo [4]). Instead these data show that the industrial\nDepression was immediately severe and deep. In contrast, agriculture, which\naccounted for about the same share of employment as manufacturing in 1929,\ndoes not experience a drop in hours or real output. In fact, hours worked in\nagriculture actually rise slightly between 1929 and 1931, increasing by about\n1.5 percent.",
