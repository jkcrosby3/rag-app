  "text": "imit competition and\nhis strong support of high wages and unions was similar to Roosevelt's New\n14\n\nDeal. I next describe Hoover's 1929 program for raising real wages and\nredistributing income from capital to labor.\n4. Hoover's Labor Program\nIn November, 1929, Hoover met with the leaders of the major industrial\n\frms in manufacturing, utilities, and transportation at the White House.\nHoover presented his program for raising wages and work-sharing to avoid\n\frm-labor con\nict that he anticipated would arise. Hoover informed industry\nthat they were to bear the cost of a recession by securing from them an\nagreement to maintain or raise nominal wage rates, and to engage in work-\nsharing. In return, he secured an agreement from labor to not strike and\nto not demand further wage increases. This program is clearly consistent\nwith Hoover's preferences for fostering high real wages, supporting unions,\nand reducing the workweek.",
