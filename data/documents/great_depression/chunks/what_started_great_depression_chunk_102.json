  "text": "tracted e\u000bects. This\npaper proposes such a theory, based on President Hoover's program that of-\n51\n\nfered industrial \frms protection from unions in return for paying high wages.\nFirms deeply feared unions at this time, re\necting a growing union wage pre-\nmium and a sea change in economic policy, including policies advanced and\nsupported by Hoover, that signi\fcantly fostered unionization and enhanced\ntheir bargaining power. Consequently, there was an incentive for \frms to fol-\nlow Hoover's program of paying moderately higher real wages to avoid even\nhigher wages and lower pro\fts that would come from unionization.\nI conclude that the Depression is the consequence of government programs\nand policies, including those of Hoover, that increased labor's ability to raise\nwages above their competitive levels. The Depression would have been much\nless severe in the absence of Hoover's program.",
