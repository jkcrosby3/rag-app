Strong, who\nwas Governor of the Federal Reserve Bank of\nNew York from the System's founding in 1914\nuntil his death, dominated Federal Reserve policy-\nmaking in the years before the Depression.2\nThese researchers argue that authority was dis-\npersed after his death among the other Reserve\nBanks, whose officials were less knowledgeable\nand failed to recognize the need for aggressive\npolicies. Other researchers, like Wicker (1966),\nBrunner and Meltzer (1968), and Temin (1989),\ncontend that Strong's death caused no change in\nFed performance. They argue that Strong had\nnot developed a countercyclical policy and that\nhe would have failed to recognize the need for\nvigorous action during the Depression.",
