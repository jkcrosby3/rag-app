  "text": "nter. The choice of \ncorrespondent depended on the needs of the respondent bank and its depositors. If the latter \nwished to invest in New York or international markets, than the country bank needed a New \nYork correspondent who could handle those transactions. If the latter wished to invest in markets \ncentered in Chicago, such as agricultural commodities, then the country bank needed a \ncorrespondent in Chicago. These incentives generated a system organized geographically. \nRegional financial centers, such as Boston, Cincinnati, Philadephia, San Francisco, and St. \nLouis, served banks in the surrounding states. St. Louis correspondents, for example, primarily \nserved banks operating in Missouri and Arkansas. From these regional centers, interregional \npayments flowed primarily through New York banks. \nTable 3 presents an example of a correspondent network extending outward from a unit-\nbanking agricultural state, Mississippi, in the year 1929.",
