A discount rate increase was in-\ntended to reduce discount loans and, thus, the Fed's note\nand deposit liabilities, as well as encourage gold inflows\nas investors sought higher yields in the United States.\n34ln January 1916, the All Commodities Price Index stood at\n112.8 (1913 = 100). In April 1917 (when the United States\nentered the war), it was at 172.9. At its peak in May 1920,\nthe Index was at 246.7. It then fell to a low of 138.3 in\nJanuary 1922.\n35Before the war, the Fed lacked the resources to offset\ngold inflows, so sterilization was impossible. By the end of\n1921, the Reserve Banks had sufficient reserves to reducetheir discount rates, and individually they began to pur-\nchase government securities. By 1923, there seems to\nhave been a conscious effort to offset gold flows [Fried-\nman and Schwartz (1963), pp. 279-87].\n36These charts are reproduced by Hetzel (1985), p.",
