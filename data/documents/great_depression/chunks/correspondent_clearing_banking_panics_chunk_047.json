  "text": "rve Act 1913).\u201d In July 1916, the Federal Reserve\u2019s system of check clearing initiated \noperations. Over the next five years, operations expanded rapidly, as the Federal Reserve \nmodified services to make them more efficient, and legal changes required Fed member banks to \nclear their checks as directed by their Federal Reserve district. \n \n4 The ratio which we measure is a lower bound because it includes figures from all state commercial banks, \nincluding members of the Federal Reserve System and members of clearing houses. Federal Reserve members \ncleared checks through the system, and thus, had much lower levels of checks in transit than non-member state \nbanks. Clearing house banks, particularly in major money centers, also cleared checks more rapidly and credited \nthem more slowly than banks that cleared via correspondents.",
