  "text": "rvices. \nFiscal policy played a relatively small role in stimulating recovery in the United States. \nIndeed, the Revenue Act of 1932 increased American tax rates greatly in an attempt to balance the federal budget, and by doing so dealt another contractionary blow to the economy by further \ndiscouraging spending. Franklin Roosevelt\u2019s New Deal, initiated in early 1933, did include a \nnumber of new federal programs aimed at generating recovery. For example, the Works Progress Administration (WPA) hired the unemployed to work on government building projects, and the \nAgricultural Adjustment Administration (AAA) gave large payments to farmers. However, the \nactual increases in government spending and the government budget deficit were small relative to the size of the economy. This is especially apparent when state government budget deficits are \nincluded, because those deficits actually declined at the same time that the federal deficit rose.",
