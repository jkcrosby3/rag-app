Wicker (1966) finds, however, that\nHarrison ceased to advocate open market pur-\nchases once New York banks were no longer\nborrowing reserves. Thus, while the Federal\nReserve would likely have pursued somewhat\nmore expansionary policies had New York offi-\ncials held more authority, the modest open mar-\nket purchases of 1930 and 1931 were\napparently consistent with the guidelines out-\nlined by Strong.\nIn sum, during the Depression, the Federal\nReserve continued to sterilize gold and currency\nflows and made limited open market purchases\nand discount rate reductions in response to the\neconomic decline. Notable deviations from these\npolicies occurred, such as the incomplete sterili-\nzation of gold outflows during the crises of\n1931 and 1933.",
