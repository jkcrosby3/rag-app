  "text": "Federal Reserve member banks seeking rents\nthrough the elimination of their nonmember\nrivals.\" (p. 9) Member banks did not capture the\nFed directly, they argue, but rather exerted\npressure through members of the House and\nSenate Banking Committees. To test this hypoth-\nesis, the authors regress deposits in failed non-\nmember banks in each state on dummy varia-\nbles indicating whether a state was represented\non the House or Senate Banking Committees.72\nThey find that nonmember bank losses were\nhigher if a state had a representative on the\nHouse Banking Committee. This, they argue,\nsupports their view that the Fed deliberately\ncaused nonmember bank failures to be highest\nin states having a congressman on the Banking\nCommittee, thereby enhancing the long-run\nprofits of the member banks that remained. The\nFed's payoff came in 1933 when it was freed\nfrom having to return a portion of its revenues\nto the Treasury.73\nThis explanation of Federal Reserve policy\nprovokes a number of questions.",
