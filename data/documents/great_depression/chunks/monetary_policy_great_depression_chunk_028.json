The\nreal interest rate plotted in figure 8 is calculated as the\nprevailing yield on short-term government securities in\nJune of each year, less the rate of inflation in the subse-\nquent year. Since actual, rather than anticipated, inflation\nis used to calculate the real rate, it is considered an ex\npost, rather than ex ante, rate.17Yet another indicator is the real money supply, i.e., the\ngrowth rate of the nominal supply of money less the ex-\npected rate of inflation. Since the price level fell faster\nthan the nominal supply of money (M1 or M2) during the\nfirst two years of the Depression, Temin (1976) argues that\nmonetary conditions were not tight. The increase in real\nmoney balances was relatively slow, however, which\nHamilton (1987) argues was contractionary.\nMARCH/APRIL 1992\nDigitized for FRASER \nhttp://fraser.stlouisfed.org/ \nFederal Reserve Bank of St. Louis",
