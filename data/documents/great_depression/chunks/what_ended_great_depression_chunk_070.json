In 1938 the recovery was interrupted as real ratesturned substantially positive and spending fell sharply. Starting in 1939real rates fell again and the rapid growth of spending resumed.The relationship between spending and interest rates can be quantifiedby computing the correlations between the percentage change in fixedinvestment or consumer spending on durables and the level of the ex ante realrate. Table 2 shows these correlations, which are estimated over the period1934\u20141942. The table shows that there is a very strong contemporaneouscorrelation between interest rates and the growth rates of investment andconsumer spending on durable goods in the recovery phase of the GreatDepression.",
