Amaral and MacGee [33]\nalso use a two-sector model with in\nexible manufacturing wages and \nexible\nagricultural wages to analyze the Depression as the result of a transitory\nmonetary shock. The impact of the high real manufacturing wage in both of\nthese analyses is much smaller than here, with real output falling only about\n4 percent by 1931.",
