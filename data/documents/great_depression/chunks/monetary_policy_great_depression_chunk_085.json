  "text": "F ST. LOUIS\nDigitized for FRASER \nhttp://fraser.stlouisfed.org/ \nFederal Reserve Bank of St. Louis\n\n23\nwhy it permitted the money supply to decline\nsharply during the Depression. During a reces-\nsion, loan demand declines and banks have fewer\nprofitable investment opportunities. Consequent-\nly; the demand for borrowed reserves declines.\nIf this decline in demand is not offset, total\nreserves and the money supply fall. In a minor\nrecession, as in 1924 and 1927, member bank\nborrowing falls little. The Fed's guidelines would\nhave suggested that monetary conditions were\nrelatively tight and, in response, it would have\nmade large open market purchases. In a severe\neconomic downturn, as in 1930-31, however,\nmember bank borrowing may fall substantially.\nBut, by Strong's rule the Fed would have made\nfew open market purchases.",
