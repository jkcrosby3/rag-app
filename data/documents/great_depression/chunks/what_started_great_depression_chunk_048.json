Preventing unionization was fostered by\nover the 1920s, and not the level of the premium.\n23\n\nCourt decisions and government policies that limited the ability of unions to\norganize and that favored \frms during strikes. Ebel and Ritschl [23] summa-\nrize Court decisions and how they signi\fcantly impeded union organization.\nThere is considerable discussion of the limited ability of unions to organize\nin the 1920s among labor historians, which I summarize here (Bernstein [21]\nis a standard reference). Prevention methods included company unions and\nmodest corporate welfare programs that are widely perceived to have kept\nunions out of the workplace, and the use of violence when unions attempted\nto organize or when workers called a strike. Gittelman [24], Ozanne [16],\nand Jacoby [25] describe the use of company unions and welfare programs,\nand Bernstein [21] describes \frm violence during several union organization\nattempts and strikes during the early and mid-1920s.",
