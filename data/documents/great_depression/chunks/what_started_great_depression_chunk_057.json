The Hoover Economy\nHoover's plan provided \frms with protection from unions if industry\nmaintained/raised their nominal wages and spread work by reducing the\naverage length of the workweek. To quantify the contribution of this policy\nto the Depression, I construct a general equilibrium model tailored to capture\nthe main features of the Hoover program. Since the Hoover program did not\na\u000bect all sectors, I construct a two sector model in which one sector is sus-\nceptible to unionization and thus is a\u000bected by the Hoover program, and the\nother sector is not susceptible to unionization and thus is not impacted by\nthe Hoover program. I will refer to these two sectors as manufacturing, and\nagriculture, respectively, with the agricultural sector including agriculture\nand other sectors in which potential unionization was less likely.\nTime is discrete and denoted by t= 0;1;2;:::1.",
