For \nexample, the prices of coffee, cotton, silk, and rubber were reduced by roughly half just between September 1929 and December 1930. As a result, the terms of trade declined precipitously for \nproducers of primary commodities. \nThe U.S. recovery began in the spring of 1933. Output grew rapidly in the mid-1930s: \nreal GDP rose at an average rate of 9 percent per year between 1933 and 1937. Output had fallen \nso deeply in the early years of the 1930s, however, that it remained substantially below its long-\nrun trend level throughout this period. In 1937\u201338 the United States suffered another severe downturn, but after mid-1938 the American economy grew even more rapidly than in the mid-\n1930s. U.S. output finally returned to its long-run trend level in 1942. \nRecovery in the rest of the world varied greatly.",
