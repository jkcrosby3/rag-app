Three more did so during the next month. The effects of these suspensions spread across \nstate lines. On November 20, the Hannibal Trust Company (Hannibal, MO) suspended \noperations due to \u201cheavy withdrawals due to closing of a number of banks in their section at \nQuincy, Illinois.\u201d The closing of the Hannibal Trust Company forced one of its clients, the \nFarmers Bank (Oakwood, MO), to suspend operations later that afternoon. \nSimilar dominoes of collapsing correspondent networks radiated out from Sioux City, \nIowa and Clarksdale and Tupelo, Mississippi during December, 1930. On December 6, both the \nSioux City National Bank and the First National Bank in Sioux City suspended operations due to \n\u201cslow, doubtful, or worthless paper.\u201d Two days later, the Leeds Bank of Sioux City, a client of \nthe former, closed its doors.",
