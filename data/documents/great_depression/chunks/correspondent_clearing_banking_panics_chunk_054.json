  "text": "pect. The \nFederal Reserve did not immediately credit out-of-town checks to the accounts of banks \n\n 18 that deposited them. The Fed imposed a waiting period whose length was based on the \ntypical length of time that it took for a check drawn on a type of bank in a particular \nlocation to remit funds. \n The waiting periods varied up to eight business days depending on the distance \ninvolved and the type of bank on which the draft was drawn. The schedule of the Federal \nReserve Bank of New York was the most expeditious. New York provided immediate \ncredit for drafts deposited before 9 am and payable at New York City Clearing House \nAssociation Banks, Northern New Jersey Association Clearing House Banks, or certain \nother New York and Brooklyn banks. It also provided immediate credit for drafts drawn \non its own members and certain warrants and obligations of the United States Treasury \nand the Federal Reserve System.",
