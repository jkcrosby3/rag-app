Of these steps, by far the most difficult one is estimatingthe multipliers for monetary and fiscal policy. The approach that I usefocusses on two policy experiments that bracket the recoveryperiod. In 1920and 1937 there were major contractionary shifts in both monetary and fiscalpolicy. Relatively severe recessions followed each of these shifts.Furthermore, there do not appear to have been any other significant changes inthe economic environment in these years that could account for the recessions.As a result, one can decompose the percentage change in real output(relative to normal growth) in each of these two episodes into the part due tolagged monetary changes and the part due to lagged fiscal changes.
