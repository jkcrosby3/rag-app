Simon's evidence indicates that\nthe gap between the actual wage and the market clearing wage was not only\nlarge, but that it did not respond to what clearly should have been very\nstrong competitive forces that should have reduced the wage and increased\nemployment. These data are also consistent with a substantial labor market\n8\n\ndistortion which kept the industrial wage far above its market-clearing level.\nThis analysis suggests that the key to understanding the Depression is\nunderstanding and quantifying this labor market distortion. The next section\nproposes a theory for this distortion based on Herbert Hoover's industrial\nlabor market program which, in conjunction with de\nation, fostered higher\nreal wages in the industrial sector, and which prevented those wages from\ndeclining, even in the face of strong countervailing economic forces.\n3.",
