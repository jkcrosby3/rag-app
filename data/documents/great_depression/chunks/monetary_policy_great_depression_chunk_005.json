Most explanations fall into two cate-\ngories. One holds that Fed officials, though well-\nintentioned; failed to understand that more ag-\ngressive action was needed. Some researchers,\nlike Friedman and Schwartz (1963), argue that\nthe Fed's behavior during the Depression con-\ntrasted sharply with its behavior during the\n1920s.
