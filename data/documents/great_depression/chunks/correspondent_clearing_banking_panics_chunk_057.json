  "text": "ensions. Richardson (2005) delves into details of the \ndefinitions and the data collection process. \nIn the Federal Reserve\u2019s lexicon, a suspension was a bank that closed its doors to \ndepositors and ceased conducting normal banking business for at least one business day. Some, \nbut not all, suspended banks reopened for business. A liquidation was a permanent suspension. A \nliquidating bank closed its doors to the public, surrendered its charter, and repaid depositors, \nusually under the auspices of a court appointed officer known as a receiver. A voluntary \nliquidation was a category of closure in which banks ceased operations and rapidly arranged to \nrepay depositors the full value of their deposits. Voluntary liquidations did not require the \nservices of receivers and were not classified as suspensions. A consolidation (or merger) was the \ncorporate union of two or more banks into one bank which continued operations as a single \nbusiness entity and under a single charter.",
