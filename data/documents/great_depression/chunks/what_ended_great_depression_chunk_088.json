  "text": "high\u2014powered money as the policy variable would resultin a negative multiplier for monetary policy. The peculiar behavior of high\u2014 powered money in these two episodes is due to the fact that the monetary policy actions undertaken in both 1920 and 1937 were ones that tended todecrease the amount of money in circulation relative to the stock of reserves. Since the amount of money in circulation is what is likely to affect interest rates and spending, Ml is clearly a more sensible measure of monetary policy in these two episodes. Another alternative measure of monetary policy that one could use would be some measure of the change in real money growth; that is, the change in Ml relative to the price level. However, this would not be sensible given that this paper seeks to identify the contribution of aggregate demand policy to the recovery.",
