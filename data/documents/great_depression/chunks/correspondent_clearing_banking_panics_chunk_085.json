  "text": "xt domino \ndisappeared, and it suspended operations also, which forced additional dominoes to fall. \n Accounting conventions employed by correspondent banks exacerbated the situation. \nBanks that cleared via correspondents counted checks in transit as part of their reserves. This \nconvention exaggerated on paper the resources available to individual institutions and the system \nas a whole in reality. Banks\u2019 balance sheets indicated that they possessed abundant reserves, \nwhen in reality, they possessed few, if any, resources. The summer and fall of 1930 witnessed \nthe historical peak in the accumulation of these fictitious reserves. The panics that began in \nOctober of that year forced the revelation of banks\u2019 reserve positions. Simultaneous revelation \nrevealed the cancer lurking within the correspondent system. In such circumstances, it is no \nwonder that the system collapsed so suddenly and so extensively.",
