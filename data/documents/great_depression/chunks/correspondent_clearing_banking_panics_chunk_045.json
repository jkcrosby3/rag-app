An event, \n\n 15 such as a banking panic, that forced banks to convert reserves into cash, would reveal that the \nmuch of the reserves in any correspondent chain consisted of fictitious figures based on the \nmultiplication of the value of checks in transit. \nPrecise data on the quantity of fictitious reserves does not exist, but extant sources yield \nclosely related statistics. One is the ratio of checks in transit to bankers\u2019 balances for state \ncommercial banks. This is a lower bound for the share of reserves which were fictitious.4 Figure \n1 displays the data for July 1 of each year from 1913 to 1940. The ratio peaked in 1930, when \nfloat approached 60% of bankers\u2019 balances. This percentage was nearly twice the proportion \nprevailing during the preceding decade. The percentage was more than four times the proportion \nprevailing following the trough of the contraction.",
