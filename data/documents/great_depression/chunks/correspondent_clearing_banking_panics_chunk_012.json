Fictitious reserves peaked during the fall harvest season, when \nthe flow of funds through correspondent networks to country banks and their agricultural clients \npeaked. Fictitious reserves also fluctuated with the behavior of bankers and the business cycle. \nEvidence indicates that the ratio of checks in transit relative to bankers\u2019 balances, a measure of \nthe share of reserves which were fictitious, rose rapidly during the 1920s and peaked in fall of \n1930, immediately preceding the onset of banking panics.",
