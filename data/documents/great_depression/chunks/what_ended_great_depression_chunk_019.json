  "text": "are no additional factors thataccount for the severe recessions that followed the shifts in policy. Again,if other factors were important, my procedure would overestimate the impact of\nthe policy changes.This method of deriving rough estimates of the effects of policy is anexample of what David Romer and I have referred to in previous work as thenarrative approach [1989 and 1990). The basic idea is that to estimate theimpact of policy, particularly of monetary policy, one often does not want touse a regression of output on the monetary policy variable or even theestimation of a big macroeconomic model of the U.S. economy. The reason forthis is that any regression procedure is likely to pick up both the effect ofmoney on output and the endogenous response of money to movements in realoutput.",
