For example, in May, 1922, the union\nrate for wood patternmakers in Chicago was about 40 percent more than the\nwage paid for the same occupation by International Harvester and Western\nElectric, both non-union shops (Ozanne [16]).\nThe perceived threat of unionization raised wages of non-union works\nduring this period. Ozanne noted that International Harvester gave out\nwage increases only \"to buy o\u000b labor and prevent unionism\", and did not\nraise wages when unions were not perceived to be a threat. Firms that\nfeared unionization tended to pay higher wages. \"Union wage in\nuence was\nfelt through wage concessions by employers who feared being unionized.
