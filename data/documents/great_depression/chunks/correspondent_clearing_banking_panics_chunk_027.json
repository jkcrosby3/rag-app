The correspondent cleared the \nchecks through the most convenient method, either through a clearing house, through the Federal \nReserve System, or by directly contacting the institution on which the checks were drawn. \nCountry banks found the services of city correspondents economical, because a correspondent \nenabled them to clear checks by making a small number of daily deposits via the United States \npostal service, rather than employing a staff of clerks to handle the volume of correspondence \nneeded to send each check directly to bank of origination. Correspondent clearing also enabled \ncountry banks to avoid exchange charges, the fee that many banks charged for remitting \npayment for checks drawn on them not cashed over the counter.",
