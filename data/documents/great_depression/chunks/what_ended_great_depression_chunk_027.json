  "text": "iedman and Schwartz, for example, attributeboth downturns almost entirely to monetary developments. They state: \"in1920\u201421 and 1937\u201438, the decline in the money stock was a consequence ofpolicy actions of the Federal Reserve System .... Inboth cases thesubsequent decline in the money stock was associated with a severe economicdecline\" [1963, p. 678]. This emphasis on monetary factors in 1921 and 1938\nis echoed by Lewis [1949, pp. 19\u201420) and Roose [1954, p. 239].Other authors assign a much more important role to fiscal policy as thesource of these two interwar downturns. Hansen (1938], Smithies [1946), andCordon [1974] all attribute the recession of 1938 to the decline in governmentspending. Ayres writes of the decline in government expenditures that \"itseems wholly probable that we have here the chief explanation of theexceptionally abrupt decline in business activity which took place in theautumn of 1937\" (1939, p. 1521.",
