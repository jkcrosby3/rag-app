Hoover as a New Dealer\nWhile Herbert Hoover is often portrayed as a market-oriented President,\nsome of his labor and industrial policies were thematically similar to Roo-\nsevelt's New Deal policies. Like Roosevelt, Hoover created policies that al-\nlowed industry to cooperate in order to stem what he perceived to be the\ndepressing e\u000bects of \"cutthroat competition\". And like Roosevelt, Hoover\nbelieved high wages were the key to prosperity. Hoover's policies began in\nthe 1920s as Commerce Secretary. It is well documented that Hoover helped\ncreate industry trade associations for the purpose of \frm cooperation, includ-\ning sharing data on cost, output, and prices, and promoting standardization\nof products.
