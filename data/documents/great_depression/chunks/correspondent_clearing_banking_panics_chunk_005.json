  "text": "l banking \n\u2018holiday.\u2019 \n Economists have long debated the reasons for the banking system\u2019s collapse. A \ntraditional school of scholarship maintains that the underlying causes were withdrawals of \ndeposits, illiquidity of assets, and the Federal Reserve\u2019s reluctance to act (Friedman and \nSchwartz, 1963; Elmus Wicker, 1996). A contending school concludes that banks failed because \nthe economy contracted. Asset prices fell. Loan default rates rose. Banks became insolvent. \nThese fundamental forces accentuated a process of bank liquidation and that began during the \n1920s (Temin, 1976; Charles Calomiris and Joseph Mason, 2003). \nThese opposing views exist for many reasons. A principal one is differences in data \nsources. Scholars in the traditional school analyze data aggregated at the national or regional \nlevel.",
