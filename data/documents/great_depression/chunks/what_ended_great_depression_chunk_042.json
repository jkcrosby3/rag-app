Hence, it is not at allsurprising to find that had this deviation from normal been held at zero, therecovery from the Depression would have been dramatically slower.\nD. RobustnessThe results of these simulations are quite robust. The stance of\n\n18monetary policy was so expansionary during the recovery, and the stance offiscal policy was so non\u2014expansionary, that changing the multipliers evensubstantially would not make monetary policy unimportant and fiscal policycrucial.One way to see this is to imagine cutting the monetary policy multiplierin half and doubling the fiscal policy multiplier.10 This change represents avery extreme change in the monetary policy multiplier.",
