This makes sense asa measure of normal policy because a constant deficit or surplus should leave\naggregate demand unchanged (except for balanced budget multiplier effects).8In describing the framework for calculating multipliers, I assumed thatthe policy variables affect output with a one\u2014year lag. While this is a crudeassumption, for the two episodes in question it is surely reasonable. Inannual data the main falls in real output In these episodes occur between 1920and 1921 and between 1937 and 1938. The main monetary and fiscal policymovements in each episode, however, occur in the year before the largedeclines in real output.",
