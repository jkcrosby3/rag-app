Nearly one-third of the depository institutions in operation at the onset of \nthe downturn disappeared during the contraction. Bank failures often occurred in clusters \ncharacterized as crises. The first crisis of the depression began in Tennessee in the fall of 1930 \nand engulfed hundreds of banks in neighboring states. The final crisis began in Michigan in the \nwinter of 1933, when to forestall runs on financial institutions, the governor ordered the state\u2019s \nbanks to suspend operations. Neighboring states followed Michigan\u2019s example, igniting a chain \nreaction of state moratoria that forced President Roosevelt to declare a national banking \n\u2018holiday.\u2019 \n Economists have long debated the reasons for the banking system\u2019s collapse.",
