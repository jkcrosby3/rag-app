  "text": "tor series and the real GNP series for 1929\u20141942 are from the National Income and Product Accounts\n\n[1986]; data for 1919\u20141928 are from Romer (19881. The administrative budgetdata are used instead of the NIPA surplus data because they are available on a consistent basis for the entire interwar era. While the two surplus seriesdiffer substantially in some years, the gross movements in the two series aregenerally similar. The surplus is divided by GNP to scale the variablerelative to the economy.\n8.In place of the actual surplus to CNP ratio one could use the full\u2014employment surplus to GM? ratio. I do not use this variable because it treatsa decline in revenues caused by a decline in income as normal rather thanactivist policy. This is inappropriate for the prewar and interwar eras whenraising taxes in recessions was usually preferred to letting the budget slipseriously into deficit.",
