  "text": "decrease in the surplusto CNP ratio of 1 percentage point results in real QNP growth over the next\n\nfour quarters that is 2.13 percentage points above the baseline projection.This multiplier for fiscal policy is roughly 10 times larger than that derived\nfrom the 1921 and 1938 episodes.12Using the multipliers from the MPS model in place of those derived frommy calculation does not change the conclusions appreciably. Substituting inthe short\u2014run MPS multiplier for monetary policy increases the apparentimportance of monetary policy: real GNP in 1942 would have been roughly 70percent lower than it actually was had monetary policy been held to its usualcourse. Using the much larger MPS multiplier for fiscal policy clearlyincreases the role for fiscal policy, but not dramatically so. According tothis simulation, if fiscal policy had been held to its usual level, real GNPin 1942 would have been 14 percent lower than it actually was.",
