Nominal interest rates declined around the same timethat money growth expanded rapidly. For example, the commercial paper ratedropped from 2.63 percent to 1.25 percent between the second and fourthquarters of l933.j However, in an environment where prices are changing\n\n26rapidly, nominal interest rates are clearly not the best indicator of the costof borrowing. Rather, one wants to consider the behavior of real interestrates. This is especially true given the fact that nominal interest rateswere close to zero by 1934.
