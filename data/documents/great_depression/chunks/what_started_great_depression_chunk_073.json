The decline in hours re\nects a 38 percent drop in steady state industrial\nhours worked (H m) and an eight percent drop in steady state agricultural\nhours worked (H a). The decline in agricultural hours re\nects a 30 percent\ndecline in the agricultural wage, which in turn re\nects a 20 percent decline\nin the relative price of agricultural output.",
