TheMPS model is the main forecasting model currently used by the Federal ReserveBoard and is generally thought to be based both on good economic theory andcareful data analysis. In this model, the short\u2014run multiplier for monetarypolicy is 1.2; that is, a one\u2014time increase in Ml above the baselineprojection of 1 percentage point results in real CNP growth over the next fourquarters that is 1.2 percentage points above the baseline projection. Thisshort\u2014run multiplier for monetary policy is slightly larger than themultiplier derived from the 1921 and 1938 episodes.
