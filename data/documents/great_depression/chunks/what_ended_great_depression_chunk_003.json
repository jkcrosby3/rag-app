By any prewar or postwar metric these ratesof growth are spectacular, even for an economy pulling out of a severedepression. Yet the recovery from the collapse of 1929\u20141933 has receivedlittle of the recent attention that economists have lavished on the GreatDepression. Perhaps because the cataclysm of the early 1930s was so severe,modern economists have focused on the causes of the downturn and of theturning point in 1933. Once the end of the precipitous decline in output hasbeen explained, there has been a tendency to let the story drop.",
