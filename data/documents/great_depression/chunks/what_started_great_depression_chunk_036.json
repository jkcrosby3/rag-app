These large nominal industrial wage cuts from 1921-22 stand in sharp\n17\n\ncontrast to the relative \fxity of nominal wages under Hoover.4.\nFirms also followed Hoover's request for work-sharing, as the average\nworkweek in manufacturing had declined by about 20 percent by September,\n1931, compared with about a 30 percent decline in employment. In contrast,\nthe workweek changed very little during \nuctuations prior to Hoover, with\nabout 80 percent of the cyclical change in hours worked being accounted\nfor by changes in employment. For example, manufacturing employment\ndeclined about 25 percent during the 1921-22 recession, but the workweek\ndeclined only about 3 percent.\nThere is considerable evidence that indicates that Hoover was responsible\nfor nominal wage \fxity.",
