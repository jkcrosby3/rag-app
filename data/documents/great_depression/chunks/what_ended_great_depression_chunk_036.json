  "text": "estimated fiscal policy multiplier would have onlysmall effects on the conclusions that follow.\nC. SimulationsArmed with these multipliers, it is possible to calculate the likelyeffects of monetary and fiscal developments during the mid\u2014 and late\u20141930s.As I have set up the analysis, the multiplier times the policy measure laggedone year shows the effect of policy on the deviation of output growth fromnormal in a given year. If one subtracts this effect of unusual policy fromthe actual growth rate of real output, one is left with a series on what thegrowth rate of output would have been under normal policy. Accumulating thesegrowth rates of real output under normal policy and then adding them to thelevel of output starting in some base year yields a series on the level of\noutput under normal policy.The difference between the path of actual output and the path of outputunder normal policy shows how much slower the recovery would have been in theabsence of expansionary policy.",
