  "text": "in\nthe United States.\nHoover also supported unions by intervening in industrial-labor relations\n13\n\nrelated to working conditions and the length of the workweek. The most\nstriking case of this was in the steel industry. Following unsuccessful attempts\nby the union to reduce the workweek, Hoover, as Harding's Secretary of\nCommerce, convinced Harding to pressure the steel industry to reduce the\nworkday from 12 hours to 8 hours. \"I instituted an investigation by the\nDepartment of Commerce into the 12 hour day. It was barbaric. I opened\nthe battle by inducing President Harding to call a dinner conference of steel\nmanufactures at the White House on May 18, 1922. The manufacturers, such\nas Charles Schwab and Judge Elbert H. Gary (Gary was Chairman of US\nSteel, which had defeated the union during a series of violent strikes in 1919),\nresented my statement which asserted that it (12 hour day) was unsocial and\nuneconomic.",
