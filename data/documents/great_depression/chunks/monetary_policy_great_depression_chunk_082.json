  "text": "e of our best guides would be the\namount of borrowing by member banks in prin-\ncipal centers. . . . Our experience has shown\nthat when New York City banks\nare borrowing in the neighborhood of 100 mil-\nlion dollars or more, there is then some real\npressure for reducing loans, and money rates\ntend to be markedly higher than the discount\nrate. On the other hand, when borrowings of\nthese banks are negligible, as in 1924, the\nmoney situation tends to be less elastic and if\ngold imports take place, there is liable to be\nsome credit inflation, with money rates drop-\nping below our discount rate. When member\nbanks are owing us about 50 million dollars or\nless the situations appears to be comfortable,\nwith no marked pressure for liquidation. . . .57\nTable 1 compares Federal Reserve actions dur-\ning the 1924, 1927 and 1930-31 downturns. The\nFed's index of industrial production indicates\nthe severity of each recession.",
