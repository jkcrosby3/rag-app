I find that themonetary expansion was primarily due to gold inflows, which were themselvesdue to devaluation in 1933 and to capital flight from the politicalinstability in Europe after 1935. Estimates of the cx ante real rate suggestthat, coincident with these gold inflows, real interest rates fellprecipitously in 1933 and remained low or negative throughout most of thesecond half of the 1930s. These low real interest rates are closelycorrelated with a strong rebound in interest\u2014sensitive spending. Thus, itseems quite plausible that the expansionary monetary developments were workingthrough a conventional interest\u2014rate transmission mechanism.The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. Section II presentskey facts about the strength and timing of the recovery phase of the GreatDepression.",
