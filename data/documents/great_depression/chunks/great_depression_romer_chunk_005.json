Britain did not slip into severe depression, \nhowever, until early 1930, and the peak-to-trough decline in industrial production was roughly \none-third that of the United States. France also experienced a relatively short downturn in the \nearly 1930s. The French recovery in 1932 and 1933, however, was short-lived. French industrial production and prices both fell substantially between 1933 and 1936. Germany\u2019s economy \nslipped into a downturn early in 1928 and then stabilized before turning down again in the third \nquarter of 1929. The decline in German industrial production was roughly equal to that in the United States. A number of countries in Latin America slipped into depression in late 1928 and \nearly 1929, slightly before the U.S. decline in output.",
