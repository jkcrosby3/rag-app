The conventional wisdom isthat the U.S. economy remained depressed for all of the 1930s and onlyreturned to full employment following the outbreak of World War II. Theresolution of these two seemingly disparate views is that the falls in realoutput in the early 1930s. and again in 1938, were so large that it took manyyears of unprecedented growth to undo these declines and return real output tonormal.\nFor most of the analysis in this paper I examine annual estimates ofreal CNP from the Bureau of Economic Analysis [1986]. Because this seriesonly begins in 1929, I extend it, when necessary, with my revised version ofthe Kendrick\u2014Kuznets CNP series (see Romer, [19881). The percentage changesin real GNP shown in Figure 1 clearly demonstrate both the enormity of thecollapse of real output between 1929 and 1933 and the strength of thesubsequent recovery. Between 1929 and 1933.",
