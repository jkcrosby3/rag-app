  "text": "decline in utilization was due to plant closings, rather\nthan a shorter workweek across all plants. Another is that some worksharing was such that\nworkers were employed for fewer days, but the plant could have had the same workweek\nlength. I am unaware of data that can provide any type of detail on these distinctions,\nhowever, so I will treat the model as a parsimonious tool for capturing low capital input\nduring the Depression, as it will allow the model to be consistent with actual manufac-\nturing output per hour. This treatment is also reasonable because there is evidence that\nworksharing that reduces the number of days an employee works, even keeping the length\nof the workweek \fxed, also reduces output per hour (see Lanoie, Raymond, and Shearer\n[31]).\n29",
