  "text": "nominal rates.The simplest way to estimate real interest rates Is to consider the cxpost real rate. To calculate cx post real rates I use quarterly data on the 4to 6 month commercial paper rate and subtract off the actual change in theproducer price index over the following quarter (at an annual rate).19 Thenominal commercial paper rate and the ex post real rate are graphed in Figure7. The figure shows that ex post real rates dropped precipitously at thestart of the monetary expansion in 1933 and remained low or negative for therest of the decade (except for the rise during the monetary contraction of1937\u20141938). Indeed, the drop in cx post real rates between the contractionaryand expansionary phases of the Great Depression is remarkable. Ex post realrates fell from values over 15 percent in the early 1930s to values typicallyaround \u201410 percent in the inid\u2014l930s and early 1940s.",
