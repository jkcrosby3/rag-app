As described previously, I define usualoutput growth as the average annual growth rate in the period 1923\u20141927. Forthe monetary and fiscal policy variables I then use measures that compare thepolicy action in a given year to the usual, long\u2014run value of that policy. Inessence, I assume that there is some usual policy stance that would keepaggregate demand and real output growing at its trend rate. Only deviationsof monetary and fiscal policy from their normal stances would result in ashift in aggregate demand and hence in a deviation of real output growth from\nnormal.For the monetary policy variable I use the deviation of the annual(December to December) growth rate of Ml from its usual growth rate, whereusual is again defined as the average annual growth rate between 1923 andl927.",
