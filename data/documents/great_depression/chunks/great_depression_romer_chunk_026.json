  "text": "articularly dramatic. The American \nmoney supply increased nearly 42 percent between 1933 and 1937. This monetary expansion \nstemmed largely from a substantial gold inflow to the United States, caused in part by the rising political tensions in Europe that eventually led to World War II. Worldwide monetary expansion \nstimulated spending by lowering interest rates and making credit more widely available. It also \ncreated expectations of inflation, rather than deflation, and so made potential borrowers more confident that their wages and profits would be sufficient to cover their loan payments if they \nchose to borrow. One sign that monetary expansion stimulated recovery in the United States by \nencouraging borrowing was that consumer and business spending on interest-sensitive items such as cars, trucks, and machinery rose well before consumer spending on services. \nFiscal policy played a relatively small role in stimulating recovery in the United States.",
