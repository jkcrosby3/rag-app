Currency\nheld by the public is a use of reserves: in-\ncreases in public currency holdings reflect\nreserve withdrawals from banks. Thus, if not\noffset, an increase in currency would correspond\nto a decrease in bank reserves. The difference\nbetween gold and currency is plotted in figure 9.\nIt is clear that net increases (decreases) in this\ndifference were largely offset by declines (in-\ncreases) in Fed credit outstanding, so that total\nbank reserves changed relatively little.\nIt is also clear that Benjamin Strong's death\ndid not interrupt the offsetting of gold and cur-rency flows, at least until the fourth quarter of\n1931. The money supply contraction and defla-\ntion during the first two years of the Depres-\nsion were not caused by a decline in bank\nreserves.",
