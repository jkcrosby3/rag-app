  "text": "gold and\ncurrency outflows suffered by banks permitted\nthe money supply contraction to accelerate. Fed\nofficials claimed that the Reserve Banks' lack of\nreserves precluded government security pur-\nchases to offset the reserve losses suffered by\nbanks.45 The Reserve Banks were required to\nmaintain gold reserves equal to 40 percent of\ntheir note issues and reserves of either gold or\n\"eligible paper\" against the remaining 60 per-\ncent.46 Since gold outflows had reduced the Sys-\ntem's reserve holdings, and since the System\nlacked other eligible paper, Fed officials asserted\nthey could not increase Fed credit by purchas-\ning government securities, which were not eligi-\nble collateral.\nFriedman and Schwartz (1963), pp. 399-406,\ndispute the Fed's justification for not buying\ngovernment securities. They argue that the Sys-\ntem had sufficient gold reserves and, in any\nevent, that the Federal Reserve Board had the\npower to suspend the reserve requirementstemporarily.",
