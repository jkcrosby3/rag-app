  "text": "t I conclude. Economists have made a great deal of progress in understanding the \nGreat Depression. Milton Friedman and Anna Schwartz deserve enormous credit for bringing the role \nof monetary factors to the fore in their Monetary History . However, expanding the research focus to \ninclude the experiences of a wide range of countries has both provided additional support for the role \nof monetary factors (including the international gold standard) and enriched our understanding of the \ncauses of the Depression. \nSome important lessons emerge from the story. O ne lesson is that ideas are critical. The gold \nstandard orthodoxy, the adherence of some Federal Reserve policymakers to the liquidationist thesis, \nand the incorrect view that low nominal interest rates necessarily signaled monetary ease, all led \npolicymakers astray, with disastrous consequences. We should not underestimate the need for careful \nresearch and analysis in guiding policy.",
