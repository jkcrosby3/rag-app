  "text": "y policy variable enters the regression with a coefficientof \u20140.463 and has a t\u2014statistic of \u20143.02. This suggests that on average inthe interwar sample period monetary developments had a substantial negativecorrelation with real interest rates.The fitted values of this regression are graphed in Figure 8. As\n\n28described before, these fitted values provide an estimate of the ex ante realrate. These estimates of the real rate show the same marked drop that the expost real rate showed, and the drop is again nearly contemporaneous with theswitch to expansionary monetary policy in 1933.22 While one cannot be surethat actual real rates dropped the same amount as these estimates or that the\ndrop was caused by monetary developments, the regression results certainlysuggest that the expansionary monetary developments of the mid\u2014 and late\u20141930sdid have a substantial impact on real interest rates.",
