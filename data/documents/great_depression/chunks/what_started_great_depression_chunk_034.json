  "text": "agreeing to Hoover's wage program, though I have been unable\nto \fnd other discussions of this.\n16\n\nHoover's program was ultimately aimed at systematically raising real wages\n- particularly non-union wages - to reverse more than a decade of what he\nperceived to be the disproportionate growth of capital income relative to\nlabor income.\n4.1. Industry and Labor Followed Hoover's Program\nFollowing their November 1929 meeting with Hoover, major industrial\n\frms either kept nominal wages \fxed, or raised wages, and spread work\nconsiderably. The pattern of \fxed/rising nominal wages during a period of\nde\nation and economic downturn di\u000bers remarkably from previous episodes.\nTo highlight this di\u000berence, I compare wages under Hoover to those during\nthe previous episode of signi\fcant de\nation (1920-22), when the CPI declined\nby about 20 percent.",
