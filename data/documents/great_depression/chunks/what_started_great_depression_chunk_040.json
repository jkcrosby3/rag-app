Walter Clark Teagle said his Standard Oil of New Jersey had found it\nnecessary to cut workers' weekly earnings by part-time employment but that\nthe base pay rate had been maintained.\" (\"Next: Wages?\", 4/13/31, Time,\npp 12-13). Most of the major manufacturing \frms that publicly advertised\nand veri\fed their compliance with Hoover were not unionized at the time,\nincluding Bethlehem Steel, Dupont, Ford, GM, Goodyear, and U.S. Steel.\nThis evidence suggests Hoover's independent in\nuence on wage setting among\nlarge-scale industry.\nNot surprisingly, the impact of high wages on pro\ftability caused consid-\nerable concern among industrial leaders, who in January 1931 argued that\n\"wage scales should be adjusted to price reduction...It is not true that high\nwages make prosperity. Instead, prosperity makes high wages.\" (New York\nTimes, January, 1931, in Executive Opinion , Kroos [19]).",
