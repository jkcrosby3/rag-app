Or were they an im-\nportant cause of the Depression? Most contempo-\nraries viewed bank failures as unfortunate for\nthose who lost deposits, but irrelevant in macro-\neconomic significance. Keynesian explanations of\nthe Depression agreed, including little role for\nbank failures. Monetarists like Friedman and\nSchwartz (1963), on the other hand, contend\nthat banking panics caused the money supply to\nfall which, in turn, caused much of the decline\nin economic activity. Bernanke (1983) notes that\nbank failures also disrupted credit markets,\nwhich he argues caused an increase in the cost\nof credit intermediation that significantly\nreduced national output.",
