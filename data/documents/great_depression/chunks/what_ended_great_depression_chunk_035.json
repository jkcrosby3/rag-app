  "text": "int lower than normalresults in real output growth that is 0.82 percentage points lower thannormal. As described in more detail below, this is quite consistent with theeffects of monetary developments found in large macromodels.The magnitude of the fiscal policy multiplier is quite small. It\n\n15implies that a rise in the surplus to GNP ratio of 1 percentage point lowersthe growth rate of real output relative to usual by 0.23 percentage points.The source of this small fiscal policy multiplier is the fact that thedeviation of real output growth from normal was slightly smaller in 1921 thanin 1938, but the fiscal policy shock was nearly four times as large in 1920 asIn 1937. As a result, it is very difficult to attribute most of the declinesin output in 1921 and 1938 to fiscal policy. I show below, however, that evenvery large changes in the estimated fiscal policy multiplier would have onlysmall effects on the conclusions that follow.\nC.",
