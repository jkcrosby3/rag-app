  "text": "een held to its usual level, real GNPin 1942 would have been 14 percent lower than it actually was. However,essentially all of this effect comes from the last year of the simulation:real GNP in 1941 would have only been 1 percent lower than it actually was iffiscal policy had been held to its usual level. Even with the much largermultiplier, fiscal policy accounts for essentially none of the recovery priorto 1942. Thus, using policy multipliers derived from a much differentprocedure than I used in my calculation leads to the same conclusion thatmonetary policy was crucial to the recovery from the Great Depression andfiscal policy was of little importance.'3One characteristic of most multipliers derived from large rnacromodels isthat the effects of aggregate demand policy on the level of real output areconstrained to be zero in the long run.",
