  "text": "money supply grew rapidly;that this rise was orchestrated by the Treasury rather than the Federal\n\n32Reserve is of secondary importance.The paper is also supportive of studies that emphasize the devaluationof 1933\u20141934 as the engine of recovery. Temin [1989] argues that thedevaluation signalled the end of a deflationary monetary regime and that thischange in regime was crucial to improving expectations. In this story it wasthe change in expectations that brought about the turning point in 1933. Mywork bolsters Temins argument by showing that the deflationary regime was\nindeed replaced by a very inflationary monetary policy. Thus, it may explainwhy the regime shift was viewed as credible. More importantly, it explainswhy the initial recovery was followed by continued rapid expansion. Withoutactual inflation and actual declines in real interest rates, the recoverystimulated by a change in expectations would almost surely have been short\u2014lived.",
