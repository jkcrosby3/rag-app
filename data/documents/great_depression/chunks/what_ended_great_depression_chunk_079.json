  "text": "ates, the recoverystimulated by a change in expectations would almost surely have been short\u2014lived. In the same way, this paper also bolsters the argument of Eichengreenand Sachs [1985] that devaluation could stimulate recovery by allowingexpansionary monetary policy. It shows that in the case of the U.S.devaluation was indeed followed by salutary increases in the money supply.On the other hand, the results here appear to contradict studies, suchas Bernanke and Parkinson [1989] and De Long and Summers [1988], that suggestthat the recovery from the Great Depression was due to the self\u2014correctivepowers of the U.S. economy in the 1930s. My finding is that aggregate demandstimulus was the main source of the recovery from the Great Depression. Thesimulations suggest that without the tremendous increases in the money supply,the economy would still have been approximately 50 percent below its pre\u2014Depression trend level in 1942, rather than back to full employment as itactually was.",
