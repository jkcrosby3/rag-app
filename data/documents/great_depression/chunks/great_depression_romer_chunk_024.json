  "text": "tionist \npolicies, however, may have contributed to the extreme decline in the world price of raw \n\nmaterials, which caused severe balance-of-payments problems for primary-commodity-\nproducing countries in Africa, Asia, and Latin America and led to contractionary policies. \n \nSources of recovery \nGiven the key roles of monetary contraction and the gold standard in causing the Great \nDepression, it is not surprising that currency devaluations and monetary expansion became the leading sources of recovery throughout the world. There is a notable correlation between the \ntime countries abandoned the gold standard (or devalued their currencies substantially) and a \nrenewed growth in their output. For example, Britain, which was forced off the gold standard in September 1931, recovered relatively early, while the United States, which did not effectively \ndevalue its currency until 1933, recovered substantially later.",
