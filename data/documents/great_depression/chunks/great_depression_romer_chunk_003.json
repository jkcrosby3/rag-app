Between the peak and the trough of the downturn, industrial production in the \nUnited States declined 47 percent and real GDP fell 30 percent. The wholesale price index \ndeclined 33 percent (such declines in the price level are referred to as \u201cdeflation\u201d). Although there is some debate about the reliability of the statistics, it is widely agreed that the \nunemployment rate exceeded 20 percent at its highest point. The severity of these declines \nbecomes especially clear when they are compared with America\u2019s next worst recession of the 20th century, that of 1981\u201382, when real GDP declined just 2 percent and the unemployment rate \npeaked at under 10 percent. Moreover, during the 1981\u2013 82 recession prices continued to rise, \nalthough the rate of price increase slowed substantially (a phenomenon known as \u201cdisinflation\u201d).",
