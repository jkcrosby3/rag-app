They calculate a share price\nindex for large New York City member banks\nand show that, relative to both the wholesale\ncommodity price index and the Standard and\nPoor's index, bank share prices declined sub-\nstantially from 1929 to 1934. They show also\nthat the index of bank stock prices was not af-\nfected by changes in the money supply, suggest-\ning that monetary policy did not enhance the\nfortunes of banks in their sample.74\nCONCLUSION\nThe Federal Reserve's failure to respond\nvigorously to the Great Depression probably\ncannot be attributed to a single cause.",
