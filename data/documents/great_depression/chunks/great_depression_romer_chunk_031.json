  "text": "al ways. \nThe Great Depression hastened, if not caused, the end of the international gold standard. \nAlthough a system of fixed currency exchange rates was reinstated after World War II under the \nBretton Woods system, the economies of the world never embraced that system with the conviction and fervour they had brought to the gold standard. By 1973, fixed exchange rates \nwere abandoned in favour of floating rates. \nBoth labour unions and the welfare state expanded substantially during the 1930s. In the \nUnited States, union membership more than doubled between 1930 and 1940. This trend was \nstimulated both by the severe unemployment of the 1930s and the passage of the National Labor \nRelations (Wagner) Act (1935), which encouraged collective bargaining. The United States established unemployment compensation and old age and survivors\u2019 insurance through the \nSocial Security Act (1935), which was passed in response to the hardships of the 1930s.",
