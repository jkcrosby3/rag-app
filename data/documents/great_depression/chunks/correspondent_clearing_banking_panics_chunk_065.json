One-quarter gray indicates banks whose slow, doubtful, and \nworthless assets forced them to close their doors and where withdrawals exacerbated the \nsituation. Examples include (i) banks forced by continuous, slow withdrawals to sell their \nprofitable assets leaving them with a problematic portfolio, and (ii) banks headed towards failure \nwhose demise was accelerated by depositors\u2019 demands (ASSETS + withdrawals). Lightly-dotted \ngray indicates banks forced to suspend solely due to problematic assets (ASSETS). \n Figure 2 demonstrates that for the contraction as a whole, asset problems were the \nprimary cause of about half of all bank liquidations (i.e. terminal suspensions) and a contributing \ncause of another one-quarter. About five in ten of the banks which went out of business, in other \nwords, had asset problems severe enough to have caused their demise.",
