  "text": "ze suggest that the Federal Reserve did notunderstand the lags with which monetary policy operated. As a result, whenthe economy failed to respond immediately to the increase in interest rates,the Federal Reserve raised the discount rate another 1 1/4 percentage pointsin January 1920 and 1 percentage point more in June 1920. Because theseenormous rises in interest rates appear to be mainly the result of Federal\nReserve inexperience, they represent independent monetary developments ratherthan a conscious response to the current state of the real economy.In 1937 the tightening of fiscal policy was less dramatic, but stillquite severe. In 1936 a large bonus had been paid to veterans of World War Iand this resulted in a surge in government spending. In 1937 not only wasthis surge removed, but social security taxes were collected for the firsttime.",
