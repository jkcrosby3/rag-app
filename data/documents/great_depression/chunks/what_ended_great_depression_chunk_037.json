  "text": "mal policy shows how much slower the recovery would have been in theabsence of expansionary policy. In calculating the path of real output undernormal policy I use 1933 as the base year. This path shows what output wouldhave done starting in 1933 under normal policy, without taking into accountthe fact that the depression was probably caused to a large extent by extreme\n\n16policy mistakes. This is appropriate because the purpose of this paper is notto argue that policy did not contribute to the downturn of the early 1930s,but rather that policy was central to the recovery in the mid\u2014 and late\u20141930s.In calculating the effects of unusual policy, I do the analysis separately formonetary and fiscal policy. In one experiment I ask what would output havebeen if fiscal policy had been held at its usual level, but monetary policywas as it actually was. In another, I hold monetary policy to its normallevel, and let fiscal policy be equal to its actual value.Fiscal Policy.",
