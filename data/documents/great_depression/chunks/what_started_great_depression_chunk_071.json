  "text": "ct that \frms and workers did not choose\nthis option suggests that the bene\ft exceeded its cost.\n35\n\ndemobilization, manufacturing hours declined considerably (falling about 25\npercent between June, 1920 and December, 1921), but almost all of this was\ndue to lower employment, as hours per worker only fell about 3.5 percent\nduring this period. This cyclical stability of hours changed remarkably after\nHoover's intervention, with the workweek declining about 2/3 as much as\nemployment declined between late 1929 and late 1931.10.\nComputing the equilibrium path requires a terminal condition. I choose\nthe terminal condition to be the steady state of the Hoover economy, with\nthe manufacturing wage permanently above its competitive level. The per-\nmanent impact of the policy is consistent with the fact that labor policies\nchanged permanently under Hoover, and is consistent with Hoover's goal of\npermanently raising real wages, particularly for non-union workers.",
