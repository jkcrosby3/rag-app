Thedashed line shows the path of log output under the assumption that fiscalpolicy was at its usual level throughout the mid\u2014 and late\u20141930s; the solidline shows the path of actual log output. The great similarity of the twolines indicates that unusual fiscal policy contributed almost nothing to therecovery from the Great Depression. Only in 1942 is there a noticeabledifference between actual output and output under normal fiscal policy, andeven then this difference is small.The small estimated effect of fiscal policy obviously stems in part fromthe fact that the calculation based on 1921 and 1938 yields a small estimatedmultiplier for fiscal policy. However, it is more fundamentally due to thefact that the deviation of fiscal policy from normal was not large during the1930s.",
