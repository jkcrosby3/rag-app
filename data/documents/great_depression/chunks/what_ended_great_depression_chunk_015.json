  "text": ": this period excludes the recession andrecovery of the early 1920s and the boom of the late 1920s. It is also a\nperiod of price stability, suggesting that output was neither abnormally highnor abnormally low. The resulting figure for normal annual real CUP growth is3.15 percent. Figure 2 shows the log level of actual real CNP and trend CNPbased on this definition of normal growth. The graph shows that CUP was about38 percent below its trend level in 1935. In 1937, the economy was 26 percentbelow trend. Only in 1942 did the economy return to its trend path.The behavior of the unemployment series is perfectly consistent with thebehavior of the real GNP series. While many scholars have emphasized thatunemployment was still nearly 10 percent as late as 1940, it is also the casethat unemployment had dropped substantially from its high of 23 percent in1932.1 Indeed, the unemployment rate fell by more than four percentage pointsin both 1934 and 1936.",
