A simple calculation indicates thatnearly all of the observed recovery of the U.S. economy prior to1942 was due to monetary expansion. Huge gold inflows in themid- and late-1930s swelled the U.S. money stock and appear tohave stimulated the economy by lowering real interest rates andencouraging investment spending and purchases of durable goods.The finding that monetary developments were crucial to therecovery implies that self-correction played little role in thegrowth of real output between 1933 and 1942.\nChristina D.
