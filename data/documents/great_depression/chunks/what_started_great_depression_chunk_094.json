I \fnd that \frms choose to follow Hoover's program provided\nthat\u0015;the probability of the \frm's workers organizing, is 10 percent per\nyear or higher. Thus, it is reasonable that \frms would be willing to raise\nreal wages about 7 percent per year in order to avoid the signi\fcantly higher\nwages that a union would ultimately extract.\n8.
