To keep the notation simple, I\ndrop the industry ( i) subscript for the time being. The monopolist's pro\ft\nfunction, conditional on capital stock k;is \u0005(k);and the associated optimal\nemployment function is e(k) :\n\u0005(k) = max\nen\nY1\u0000\u001eY\u001e\u0000\u0012\nm\u0000\nhe\nk1\u0000\n\u0001\u0012\u0000we+ (1\u0000\u000e)ko\n; (13)\nwheree(k) =e;andYmis manufacturing output used in \fnal goods produc-\ntion.15\nI now use this pro\ft function to construct the industry's reservation pro\ft\nfunction, which is the outside option to the industry of rejecting the union's\no\u000ber. To do this, note that there are two payo\u000bs to industry collusion, a\nstatic payo\u000b, which is the payo\u000b from exploiting market power in the current\nproduct market, and a dynamic payo\u000b, which is the payo\u000b from the industry\ncolluding on investment.",
