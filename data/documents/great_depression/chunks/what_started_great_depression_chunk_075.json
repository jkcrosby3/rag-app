Figures 4 - 8 show the transition path of real output, consumption,\ninvestment, and hours worked in the model, compared to the actual values of\nthose variables between 1929:4 and 1931:4.12The Hoover program depresses\nthe economy substantially, reducing aggregate hours by about 20 percent by\nthe end of 1931, and reducing real GDP by about 18 percent. The model also\ngenerates a depression that is considerably worse in the manufacturing sec-\ntor, as manufacturing hours decline 33 percent by 1931:4, while agricultural\nhours fall by about 11 percent. Consumption is 12 percent lower in 1931:4,\nwhile investment is 55 percent lower at this date. Note that investment rises\ntemporarily when the policy is adopted, which is due to two simplifying fea-\ntures in the model. One is the perfect foresight assumption, and the other is\nthat there are no investment adjustment costs.",
