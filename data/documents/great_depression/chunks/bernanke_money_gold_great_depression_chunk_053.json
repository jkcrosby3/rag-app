Another lesson is that central banks and other governmental \nagencies have an important responsibility to maintain financial stability. The banking crises of the \n1930s, both in the United States and abroad, were a significant source of output declines, both \nthrough their effects on money supplies and on cred it supplies. Finally, perhaps the most important \nlesson of all is that price stability should be a key ob jective of monetary policy. By allowing persistent \ndeclines in the money supply and in the price level, the Federal Reserve of the late 1920s and 1930s greatly destabilized the U.S. economy and, through the workings of the gold standard, the economies \nof many other nations as well.",
