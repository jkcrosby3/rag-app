MonetaryPolicy inthe GreatDepression andBeyond:
TheSourcesoftheFed’sInflation Bias
OnAugust15,1971,President Nixonannounced his“NewEconomic Policy.” Nixon’s
planincludedtwofeaturesthatreflected on thestate ofAmericanmonetary policy. First, to
combatinflation, Nixonimposed wage andpricecontrols. And, second,in response to
America’slong-running andworseninginternational payments deficit,Nixonsuspended
convertibility ofthedollarinto gold. Bothpolicies were intendedto betemporary. Wageand
pricecontrolsweretemporary, butthegoldwindowappears tobe permanently shutandthe
dollarhasfloatedagainst othercurrencies since1973.
The imposition ofwageandpricecontrolsandsuspension ofdollarconvertibility
reflected thefailureofU.S.monetary policytocontrol inflation under the prevailing
international monetary regime --the Bretton Woods System. Although Bretton Woods was atits
heartagoldstandard, it did not imposethesamelevel ofdiscipline onmonetary policythatthe
pre-wargoldstandard had. Undertheclassical goldstandard, marketdrivengoldoutflows
wouldlimitinflationary moneysupplygrowthandprovide long-run pricestability. Bretton
Woods was a goldstandardmanaged bycentralbanks, however, andwithcentralbank
cooperation acountry couldrunalong-termpayments deficit ifothercountries werewilling to
holditscurrency. The Bretton Woods System ultimatelycollapsed becauseothercountries
becameunwilling to holddollarsandbecausetheUnitedStateswas unwilling toimposea
monetary policyonitselfthatwouldensureconvertibility ofdollars into gold.
TheUnitedStateshadconfronted asimilarchoice before. In 1931, uncertainty aboutthe
ability or willingness oftheUnitedStatesto remainon the goldstandardprecipitated gold
outflows that forced American monetaryauthorities tomakeadecision. Theycould chooseto
defendtheirgold reservebytightening monetary policyortheycouldsuspendconvertibility of
thedollarinto gold. In themidst oftheGreat Depression FederalReserve officials understood

thatatightermonetary policymightworsenthedownturn, buttopreservethegoldstandardthey
chose toraiseinterestratesandallowacontraction ofbankreserves.
In thispaper, Iarguethat American officials chose to abandon goldin1971becauseof
institutional andideological changesbroughtaboutbytheGreat Depression. Key changes
includedanewavenueformonetizing FederalGovernment debt, aweakening oftheFederal
Reserve System’s insulation frompoliticalinterference, andaneweconomic policyideology
thatdoubtedthe stability ofprivatemarketsandprescribed government management of
aggregate demand.
Themostimportant changeformonetary policystemming from theGreatDepression
concerned thegoldstandard. In 1931, FederalReserve officialsviewedthegoldstandardas
fundamental tolong-runeconomic prosperity andwerewilling to defendthesystemevenifit
meanttaking actions that would worsentheongoingdepression. In 1971,U.S. economic policy
makersno longer viewedthegoldstandardinthisway,andwereunwilling totightenmonetary
policyto preserve thegold standard, eventhoughtheUnitedStateshadarising rate ofinflation
andagrowingeconomy. The choicetoabandonBretton Woods was made, I argue, becausethe
GreatDepression hadweakened theideologicalunderpinnings ofthegoldstandard.t
During the Depression, the goldstandardhadfailed topreserve prosperity forthose
countries witheven the largest reserveholdings, andsuspension provedto beaprerequisite for
recovery inmostcountries (Eichengreen andSachs,1985).Although manypeoplecontinued to
viewthegoldstandardandfixedexchange ratespositively, most believedthatthegoldstandard
requiredthemanagement ofgovernment officials. Thus, after World WarII,themanagedgold
Calomiris andWheelock (1997)examineinstitutional changes toU.S. monetary policy making resulting
from the Great Depression, and arguethat those affectingthe goldstandardwere the mostimportant. That

standardofBretton Woods supplanted thepre-wargoldstandard. UnderBrettonWoods, the
UnitedStateswasable torun an inflationarymonetary policywithoutthe swift discipline ofgold
outflows. The initialimpetusfor inflation resultedfromotherchanges --increased political
pressureontheFedandattemptsto stimulate output by increasing aggregate demand,for
example, aswellas fromflawsintheFed’sbasicoperating strategy. ButunderBrettonWoods,
inflationcould gathersubstantial momentum before policy makerswereforcedtoconfrontthe
consequences oftheirpolicies. In the face ofahemorrhaging balanceofpayments deficitandno
strongideologicalattachment to gold,Bretton Woods collapsed andexternalconstraints on
domesticmonetary policywereabandoned.
Thispaperbeginswithanoverview ofmonetary policyduringtheGreat Depression. By
many,thoughnot all, possible measures, monetary policy was exceptionally contractionary
during1929-33,andIexamine whythe Fedpursuedsuchapolicyduringthisperiod.Next, I
identifyanddiscusskeyinstitutional changes tothe monetary policyenvironment thatresulted
directlyfromtheGreatDepression. Iarguethat thesechangeshelpexplaintheinflationbiasof
the Fed’s post-World WarIImonetary policy.Finally,IdescribetheFederalReserve’s
response, or lack thereof,tothe growing balanceofpayments deficitsleadingup tothe collapse
ofBretton Woods in 1971, andhowthedecisionto abandon goldin1971wasalegacyofthe
GreatDepression.
Monetary PolicyintheFirstPhaseofthe GreatDepression
Byalmostanymeasure, monetary policyduring1929-33wasadisaster: themoney
supplyandpricelevelbothfellby one-third, expostrealinterestratesreacheddouble-digits, and
banks failed by thethousands (seeTable1).Howcouldthe Fed haveletthishappen?
Theexplanations forthe Fed’sdisastrous monetary policyduringtheGreatDepression
largelyfall into twocategories. One attributes policyfailurestoinnocentmistakes orneglect,


4/14/97 4
while theother contends thattheFedwillfullyengineered contractionary monetary policyto
fosterbureaucraticobjectives, or inresponse tointerestgroup pressure. Although somepolitical
scientists andpublicchoiceeconomists favor the latterexplanation (e.g., Epstein andFerguson,
1984;Anderson, etal.,1988),mosteconomists andeconomic historians blametheFed’spolicy
onmisguided policyrules, aswellason pettyjealousies thatlimited the Fed’sabilitytorespond
decisively to rapidly changing conditions.
Themostprominent explanation ofFederalReservebehaviorduring theGreat
Depression isthatofFriedman andSchwartz (1963), whoargue thatadistinctshiftinpolicy
occurredwiththedeathin1928ofBenjamin Strong,Governor oftheFederal Reserve Bankof
NewYork. Like Fisher(1935)before them, Friedman andSchwartz (1963)contendthat Strong
understood howto employ thetoolsofmonetary policytominimize cyclicalfluctuations in
outputandpricesandtopreventorlimitfinancialpanics. Hisdeathcreatedavoidofboth
leadership andunderstanding whichlefttheFedunresponsive tofinancialcrises,bankruns, and
theircontractionary effects.
UnderStrong’sleadership, theFedhadusedthetoolsatitsdisposal to pursueboth
domestic andinternationalobjectives (Wheelock, 1991).Largeopen-marketpurchases and
discountratereductions in1924and1927wereapparent attemptsbothtoencourage domestic
economic growthandtoenableGreatBritaintoattractgoldreserves (by lowering U.S.interest
ratesrelativeto those in Britain). Open-market salesanddiscountrate hikes in 1928-29,on the
otherhand, were intended todiscourage stockmarketspeculation, whichatleast some Fed
officialsviewedasamanifestation ofinflation.
On the surface,theFed seemstohavebeen less responsive to theDepression thanithad
beentoearlier,smaller, cyclical downturns. Table 2presents aroughcomparison ofFederal
Reserve actions duringtheinitialphase oftheGreatDepression(1929-31) withFedactions

duringtherecessions of1924and1927.TheFed’sIndexofIndustrial Production serves asa
measureofeconomic activity. The index declinedapproximately 20pointsfromthecyclical
peakin April1923tothetroughin July1924.Therecession of1927wasconsiderably more
modest --the index declined 11pointsfromOctober1926to October 1927. By contrast, the
IndexofIndustrial Production declinedby42pointsbetweenJuly1929andJuly1931,and
another9pointsfrom July 1931toOctober1931.IntermsoftheFed’sbasicpolicy tools --the
discount rate andopen-market purchases ofgovernmentsecurities --theFedwasmuchless
vigorous in1929-31thanithadbeeninresponse to the smaller recessions of1924and1927.
Thisfact,alongwiththeoccurrence ofbankingpanicsandsharpdeclinesinthemoneystockand
pricelevelduring1929-31, leadFriedman andSchwartz (1963) to conclude thattheintentand
implementation ofmonetary policyduringtheGreat Depression weredramatically differentthan
theyhadbeenin1924or1927.2
DespitetheFed’sweakresponse totheDepression, some researchers arguethatpolicy
changedlittle,ifatall,withBenjamin Strong’sdeath(e.g.,Wicker, 1966;BrunnerandMeltzer,
1968;Wheelock, 1991).DuringtheDepression, theFedusedborrowed reserves(discount
windowloans)andmarketinterest ratesaspolicyguides.3Whenmemberbanksborrowed
relatively little from the Federal Reservediscountwindow ormarketinterest rates were
unusually low, Fed officials interpreted monetaryconditions as“easy.”Conversely, highlevels
2Wheelock (1991)presentseconometricestimates oftheFederalReserve“reactionfunction” for1924-
1929.Simulations ofthisfunctionalsoillustratethattheFedmadefeweropen-market purchases and cut
itsdiscountrate lessduring1929-31thanitwouldhavedoneunderthepre-1929 reactionfunction. But,as
discussed below,thisdoesnotnecessarily implythatthepolicyregime, i.e., the Fed’s objectives or
strategy,hadchanged.
Theuseofopen-marketoperations forobjectives otherthantosecureearningassetsevolvedintheearly
l920s,buttheirusetomanipulate instruments oroperating targets,suchasborrowed reserves, evolved
onlygradually astheFedgainedexperience. WellintotheDepression, thedirections tothe Fed’s trading
desk from theOpenMarketCommittee specifiedthe dollaramounts ofsecurities thedeskwasauthorized
tobuy orsell.By1932,however, discussion atOpenMarketCommittee meetings turnedmoretowardthe
desiredlevelofexcessreserves,andfocusedlessonthespecificdollarvolumeofsecuritiestobuyor sell.
Laterinthe‘30s,the Committee targetedyieldsonTreasurysecurities, aswellasexcessreserves.

ofborrowed reserves or highinterestratessignaledthatmoneywas“tight.”Oncethe
Depression began,bothborrowed reservesandinterestratesfell sharply andgenerally remained
low, giving Fedofficialstheimpressionthat moneywasplentifuland“cheap.”
The Fed’s useofdiscount window borrowing andinterestratesaspolicyguidesduring
theDepression appears consistent withthepolicyframework thatBenjamin Stronghadoutlined
whenhewasrunningtheFed.Speaking toFederalReserve officials in 1926, forexample,
Strongdescribed hisruleofthumb fordetermining howtouseopen-market policyduringa
recession:
Shouldwego intoabusinessrecession whilethememberbankswerecontinuing
toborrowdirectly500or600 milliondollars ...weshouldconsidertakingsteps
torelievesomeofthepressurewhichthisborrowing inducesbypurchasing
government securities andthusenablingmemberbanksto reduce their
indebtedness....
Asaguideto thetimingandextentofany[open-market] purchases which might
appeardesirable, oneofourbestguideswouldbetheamountofborrowing by
memberbanksinprincipal centers.... Our experience hasshownthatwhenNew
YorkCitybanksareborrowing intheneighborhood of100milliondollars or
more,thereisthensome real pressureforreducing loans,andmoneyratestend

usabout50milliondollars orlessthesituationappearstobecomfortable, with
nomarkedpressureforliquidation. (quotedby Chandler, 1958,pp.239-40)
By Strong’s guidelines, additional open-marketpurchases were not called forin1929-31. The
borrowed reserves (discount loans)ofallFedmemberbanksas well as those ofNewYorkCity
banksdeclin& ~arbelowtheirlevelsof1924and1927(seeTable 2). Similarly, money market
interestrateswere unusually low in1930-31. Thus,by Strong’s measures, the stance of
monetary policyin1930-31appears to havebeen quite easy. Policy makersinferredthat there
was little morethe Fedcould, or should,do,andthatitwasnowup,totheeconomy to respond.
As Strong(1926, p. 468) hadsaidonanotheroccasion, “TheReserveBanks do not pushcredit
intouse”(emphasis inoriginal).


4/14/97 7
Manyeconomists havenotedthatrigiduseofborrowed reservesorinterestratesas
policyinstruments will causethe moneysupplyto riseandfallprocyclically becauseborrowed
reservesandinterestrates tend tovarypositively witheconomic activity. Moreover, the banking
crisesof1929-33madeborrowed reserves an especially poorindicatorofmonetary conditions
duringtheDepression becauseafearofrunsmadebanks especially reluctant to suggest any
weakness todepositors, whichdiscount-window borrowingmight do(Wheelock, 1991).
Althoughafew System officialsquestioned thereliability ofborrowed reserves as apolicyguide
duringtheDepression, the prevailing viewwas thatmonetaryconditions wereexceptionally
easy,andthattheeconomy’s failuretoexpandwas notthefaultofmonetary policy.Wecannot
sayforcertain whether monetary policywouldhavebeen differentduring1929-31hadBenjamin
Stronglived,but it does seemtohavebeen consistent withStrong’sresponse tobusinesscycle
downturns in 1924and1927,andtheguidelines forassessing thestance ofmonetary policyhe
hadoutlined.
The Gold Crisis of1931
FederalReservepolicyduringtheinitialphaseoftheGreatDepression --fromthestock
marketcrash inOctober1929throughSeptember 1931 --was largely predictable fromthepolicy
guidelines followed by Benjamin Strongduringthe1920s.Butinterestratesanddiscount
windowborrowing shotupdramatically inthefourthweekofSeptember 1931andremained
highuntilearly1932. During thisperiod the Fedraisedits discountrate but failedtomake
significant open-market purchases, eventhoughtheDepression wasgettingworseandmonetary
conditions wereexceptionallyrestrictive.
Theyear1931wasmarkedbyaseriesoffinancialcrises thatledtosuspension ofthe
goldstandardbyanumberofEuropean countries, culminating withGreatBritainonSeptember

followtriggeredamassivegoldoutflow fromthe UnitedStatesandattendant declinein
commercial bankreserves. TheFederalReserveactedtostemtheoutflowbyraisingitsdiscount
rate--the classic defense --but did not useopen-market operationsto replacetheoutflowof
commercial bankreserves.
In the six weeksendingOctober 28, 1931,themonetary goldstockoftheUnitedStates
declinedby $727 million,or some 15percent. At thispoint, the goldstockstabilized, but
uncertainty aboutthecondition ofAmerican bankscausedbankcustomers toredeemtheir
depositsforcurrency. Betweenmid-September andtheendofDecember, currency heldbythe
publicrose$544million(11percent). Banksborrowed heavilyfromtheFederal Reserve to
replacereserveslostfromdepositredemptions forgoldandcurrency, eventhoughtheFedhad
increased itsdiscountrate from 1.5percentto3.5percent.4
TheFedmadevirtuallynoopen-marketpurchases ofgovernment securities duringthe
crisis.OnFebruary 24,1932,theFed’s securityportfolio wasthesamesizethatithadbeenon
September 16,1931,andthusopen-marketoperations hadcontributed nothingtoward offsetting
thegoldandcurrency outflows. Whileincreased discountwindow borrowingoffsetthese
outflows somewhat, memberbanktotal reserves stillfellby $540million,or22percent,between
mid-September andtheendofFebruary.
Onthesurface, theFed’s behavior inthefourthquarterof1931appearsinconsistent both
withBenjamin Strong’spolicyguidelines andwithappropriate lender oflastresort policy. As
Friedman andSchwartz (1963, pp.315-22)describe, theFedhadactedtohaltan“external drain”
ofreserves from thebankingsystem(goldoutflows), but not the “internaldrain” (conversion of
deposits into currency).
~Thisreferstothe discount rateoftheFederalReserve Bank ofNewYork.ByDecember, the discount
ratesofalltwelveReserveBankswereat3.5percentorhigher.TheFedalsoaugmented bankreservesby
purchasing bankersacceptances frommemberbanks.TheFedpurchased all eligible acceptances offered

4/14/97 9
TheFedarguedthat ithadnotmadeopen-marketpurchases duringthecrisisof1931
becauseitsownreserveposition was injeopardy. TheFederal Reserve Bankswererequiredto
maintaingoldreservesequalto 40percentoftheir notes outstanding and35percentoftheir
depositliabilities (whichconsisted mainlyofmemberbankreserveaccounts). Inaddition, the
ReserveBankswererequiredtoholdcollateral inthe form ofgoldor eligible securities against
theirnoteissues(goldheldas reserves alsocountedas collateral). Finally,theReserveBanks
wererequiredtodepositgoldwith theU.S.Treasury equaltoatleast5percentoftheirnote
issuesthatwerecollateralized by securities.
Securities eligibleforuseascollateral forFederalReservenoteissuesincludedbankers
acceptances andcommercial notestheReserveBankshadpurchased ordiscounted formember
banks, but not government securities acquiredintheopen-market. Thus,purchases of
government securitiesincreased Fedliabilities but did not addtothecollateral backingthem,and
so theFedhadtoholdexcessreserves before it couldengage in open-market purchases.5
FromJulytoOctober1931,FederalReserveBankgoldreserves declined fromover84
percentofFedliabilities to63percent.Although theFedstillhadsufficient goldtocoverits
goldreserverequirement, someofitsexcess goldreservewas used as collateral forReserve
Banknoteissues. Consequently, theFed’s “freegold,” i.e., the amount ofgoldnotcurrently
pledgedas reserves or collateral, dwindled.

include U.S. Government securities (see alsothe FederalReserve Bulletin,March1932).
Friedman andSchwartz (1963,pp. 399-406) contendthatthe Fed’s claimthatalackoffreegold
hadpreventedopen-market purchases wasaruse,thoughothers, such asEpsteinandFerguson
(1984, pp. 964-65) arguethat Fedofficials trulyfeltconstrained byalackofreserves.
Regardless ofwhetheror not the Fedwasconstrained byitscollateral requirement, the
Systemhadanother option --theFederalReserveBoardhadtherighttosuspendtheFed’s
reserverequirements. I amaware ofnoevidence that theFed considered suspension, however.
Wicker(1966,pp. 169-70)arguesthatFedofficialsfeared that open-marketpurchases would
exacerbate goldoutflowsby increasing doubt abouttheFed’s resolvetomaintainthevalueofthe
dollarin termsofgoldover the long-run. Presumably theseofficials believedthatsuspension of
theFed’s reserve requirements wouldalsocause goldoutflows, andhencethatacombination of
suspension andopen-market purchases wasuntenable.
DidTheFedFollowGoldStandard Orthodoxy?
Fed officials believed strongly in preserving the gold standard andatfirstglancetheir
policy actions appeartohavereflectedgoldstandarddoctrine. But,twoaspectsofpolicy --the
Fed’sdelayinraisingitsdiscountrate following Britain’s suspension ofthegoldstandard, and
the Fed’s long-time policyoflimitingthe impact ofgoldflowson the domestic moneysupply --
suggestotherwise.
Wicker(1996, pp. 86-94) arguesthatthegoldstandardplayedonlya“minor”role inthe
discount rate increases ofOctober1931,citing the factthatthe discountratewasnotincreased
untiltwoandone-halfweeks after Britainsuspended goldpayments andtheUnitedStateshad
experienced heavygoldoutflows. As furtherevidence, hecitesmeetingrecords oftheboardof
directorsoftheFederalReserveBank ofNewYorkinwhichGeorgeHarrison, Governor ofthe
NewYorkFed,arguedagainst raising ratesinthewakeofBritain’saction,andthenburied


4/14/97 11
defenseofgoldamongotherreasonswhenlateradvocating adiscountrateincrease. Wicker
arguesthatthe Fed’s policywas thus not a“knee-jerk” responsetogoldstandardconventions.
Chandler(1971, p.177)interpretsthe Fed’s delayinraisingitsdiscountratesomewhat
differently. He arguesthatsome Fedofficialsbelievedthatadiscount rateincreasemight
suggestweakness andtherebyexacerbate goldoutflows, thoughfearthatarateincreasemight
hurtthe economy alsoplayed some part in thedelay. Moreover, otherFederal Reserve policy
makersdid press foran immediatediscount rate increase to defendthegoldstandard. Fed
Governor EugeneMeyer, for example, argued that “anadvance in therate wascalledforby
everyknownrule,and...foreigners wouldregard itasalackofcourageiftheratewerenot
advanced” (quotedby Wicker, 1996,p.93).Friedman andSchwartz (1963,p. 383) citea
memorandum prepared forameetingofthe Fed’s OpenMarketCommittee inNovember 1931
whichconcluded thatthe“foreignanddomestic drainsuponbankreservesweremetin the
classicwayby increases inthediscount rate combined withapolicyoffreelending.” Although
disputing thememo’sconclusion regarding the policy’sefficacy, Friedman andSchwartz (1963)
agreethattheFedhadsoughttomaintain thegoldstandard.
Besidesthedelayinraisingthediscountrate in 1931,theFed’slong-standing policyof
limitingtheimpactofgoldflowson the domestic moneystockalsosuggeststhattheFedwas not
fullycommitted to thegoldstandard. Gold standarddoctrine (the “rules ofthegame”)heldthat
goldinflows(outflows) shouldbepermitted to increase(decrease) acountry’s moneystockand
price level soas to induce shifts incapital flows andthebalanceoftradethatwouldlimitfuture
goldmovements.6Sincethe earlyl920s,however, theFedhadlargelyoffsetreservefluctuations
causedby flowsofgold, currency andothersourcesbyvaryingthequantityofreserves supplied
6SeeEichengreen(1992) orTemin(1989)fordetailaboutthe operationoftheinternational goldstandard
and its roleinthe GreatDepression.

byopen-marketoperations anddiscountwindowlending. In essence, theFed “sterilized” gold
flows, as Benjamin Strongexplained in1926:
In the old days therewasadirectrelation between thecountry’s stockofgold,
bankdepositsandthepricelevelbecausebankdeposits were ...based on the
stockofgoldandborea constant relationship tothegoldstock....Butinrecent
years the relationship betweengoldandbankdeposits is nolonger as closeor
direct ...becausetheFederalReserveSystemhasgivenelasticity tothe
country’s bankreserves.... FederalReservebankcredit isanelastic buffer
betweenthecountry’s goldsupplyandbankcredit. (Strong, 1926,p. 470)
Moreover, Strong creditedthe Fedwithpreventing inflationby offsetting goldinflows in 1921
and1922:
As the flow ofgoldimports was pouringinto theUnitedStatesin 1921and
1922,manyeconomists abroad,andinthiscountryas well,expected thisinward
flowofgoldwouldresultinahugecredit expansion andaseriousprice
inflation. That nosuch expansion or inflation hastakenplace isduetothe fact
thatthe amount ofFederalReserve credit in use was diminished asgoldimports
continued. Thus ...thepresenceoftheReserveSystemmaybesaidtohave
prevented ratherthanfosteredinflation. (Strong, 1926,p.471).
Although theFedgenerallysterilized goldflows, itprovedwilling todeviatefromthat
policywhen itseemednecessary toprotectthegoldstandard. The easing ofmonetary policyin
1924and1927seemsatleastpartlymotivated by adesiretorepelgold inflows,andthereby
assistBritain’sability to maintain goldreserves(Wicker, 1966;Wheelock, 1991).Moreover,
whengoldoutflowsreduced theFed’s reserve ratio in 1920-21, theFedincreased itsdiscount
rate to7percent(alevel not reached againuntil 1973) andenduredasharpdeflation inorderto
preserveitsgoldreserve. This episode demonstrated theFed’s resolvetomaintain itsgold
reserveandset theprecedent foritspolicyinlate1931.Benjamin Strongmayhave
“discovered” andactivelyused open-market policy,but hewas unwilling to conductpolicy
outsidetheframework ofthe goldstandard. Hetestifiedin1928that
Whenyouare speaking ofeffortssimplyto stabilizecommerce, industry,
agriculture, employment andso on,withoutregard tothe penalties ofviolation
ofthegoldstandard, you are talkingabouthumanjudgment andthemanagement
ofpriceswhichIdonotbelieveinatall. (Quoted by Burgess, 1930,pp. 331).


4/14/97 13
LikeStrong,FederalReserve officials in 1931viewedpreservation ofthegoldstandard
asfundamental tolong-runeconomic stability,andto preserve the goldstandardforthe long-
termtheywerewillingtoundertake policiesthatmightbedestabilizing in the short-run. Their
responseto the goldcrisisof1931mayhavesealed the fate ofHerbertHooverand the
Republicans in Congress, however, andensuredtheelectionofpoliticians whowouldprove
willing to change dramatically theinstitutions ofmonetary policymaking inthe UnitedStates,
including the goldstandard.
Institutional ChangestotheMonetary PolicyRegime1
Theyear1932markedthebeginning ofaseriesofinstitutional reformswithpotentially
largeconsequences formonetary policy(seeTable 3). Among the most significant werethe
Glass-Steagall Actof1932,whichpermitted the FederalReserve touse government securities to
backitsnoteissues;suspension oftheinternational goldstandardby executive orderonMarch6,
1933(ratifiedby Congress onMarch9);theThomasAmendment totheAgricultural Adjustment
Actof1933which,amongotherthings,permitted theFederalReserve to adjustcommercial
bankreserverequirements; the GoldReserveActof1934,whichauthorized thepresident tofix
the dollar priceofgoldandestablished the Treasury’s Exchange Stabilization Fund;andthe
BankingActof1935,whichmarkedly alteredthe structure oftheFederal Reserve Systemand
expanded theFed’sauthoritytoadjustreserverequirements.
Bypermitting U.S.Govermnent securitiesto serve asbackingforFederal Reserve notes,
theGlass-Steagall Actof1932removed animportantconstraint ondiscretionary monetary
policyandenhanced theFed’sabilityto initiate transactions thatmonetizedgovermnent debt.8
Although he lent hisnameto theenabling legislation, CarterGlass, whohadsponsored the

originalFederalReserveAct, apparently voicedconsiderable worryabouttheinflationary
potentialofpermitting government obligations to serve as collateral forFederal Reserve notes
(Chandler 1971,p.189).I arguebelowthatGlasswas prescient in hisconcerns.9
Thenextinstitutional change came whenPresident FranklinRoosevelt suspended the
gold standardupon takingoffice inMarch1933.Roosevelt was willing --perhapsforced --to
takethe step that FederalReserveofficials hadso feared. As in othercountries, economic
recovery followed suspension andtherebygavecredibility to aregimeof“managed money”(see
Eichengreen, 1992orTemin, 1989).
Usingauthoritygrantedby theGold Reserve ActofJanuary1934,Roosevelt fixedthe
valueofgoldat$35per ounce(the previous levelhadbeen$20.67). Although theownership of
goldanditsusefordomestic payments remainedprohibited, theUnitedStatesreturnedto the
gold standard forthe settlement ofpayments with othercountries thatalsowere on the gold
standard. Therestoredgoldstandard, however, differedfundamentally fromtheprevious
standard inthedegree to whichitsoperation wasremovedfromprivate markets andplaced
under control ofgovernment authorities. Americans wereforbidden fromholdinggold,gold
clauses in privatecontracts weremadeillegal, and theTreasurywouldsellgoldonly for making
foreignpayments.

importantly, government authorities haddemonstrated awillingness tomanipulate thegold
standardto limittheextenttowhichitwouldinterferewithdiscretionary monetary policy.
Thereafter, whentheFed’s gold reserverequirement threatened tolimitmoneysupplygrowth,
thereserve requirements werereducedandultimately eliminated withapparently littledebateor
fanfare. The goldstandardas itexisted after 1933was thus fundamentally different from its
precursor, andforeshadowed theBretton Woods goldstandardthatwas toreplaceit afterWorld
WarII.
In addition to markingafundamental shift inthe degreeto whichgoldservedasa
constraint ondomesticmonetary policy, the revaluation ofgoldin1934lefttheU.S. Treasury
withacapitalgainofsome$2.8billionon itsgoldholdings. Underauthorityconveyed by the
GoldReserveActof1934,theTreasury used $2billionofitswindfalltoestablish theExchange
Stabilization Fund:“Forthepurposeofstabilizing theexchange valueofthedollar,theSecretary
oftheTreasury...is authorized...to deal ingoldandforeignexchange andsuchotherinstruments
ofcreditandsecurities as he maydeemnecessary.”
Although theoperations oftheExchangeStabilization Fundduringthel930shadlittle
effect on the quantity or growthofbankreserves, the sizeandopen-ended authorityoftheFund
waswidely viewed asathreat totheFederalReserve Systemandits ability to effect monetary
policy. Forexample, RoyYoung, thenGovernor oftheFederalReserve BankofBoston, argued
that theGold Reserve Act“gives the Secretary ofthe Treasury such powers,ofapermanent
nature, thathe couldnullifyanything we[theFederalReserve] coulddo”(quotedbyJohnson
1939,p. 36).The Commercial andFinancial Chronicle (January20, 1934, p.367)hadasimilar
reaction: “TheReserveauthorities havebeen reducedto shadowy nonentities, theFederal
ReserveSystemhaving becomesimplyanadjunctoftheUnitedStatesTreasury andtheFederal
Government, todowhatthey aretold to do.”


4/14/97 16
In addition to theExchange Stabilization Fund, additional authorities grantedthe
President andTreasury Secretary includedtherightto“request” the FederalReserve to use open-
marketpurchases to increasebankreserves by up to $3billion, and, ifthe Fedrefused,toissuea
commensurate amount offiat currency. Thispowerwasgrantedby theThomasAmendment to
theAgriculturalAdjustment Actof1933,which, along withthe Silver Purchase Actof1934,
also authorizedthe purchaseofsilverandpermitted thePresident todevaluethesilverdollar.
Between 1933and1938,the Treasury purchased 1.8billionouncesofsilver,therebyincreasing
bankreserves by $1billion(some20percentofthe totalincrease inreserves duringtheperiod).
HadthePresident chosentodevalue thedollarintermsofsilver, the Treasury wouldhavereaped
a$2.2billion windfall onitssilverholdings (Johnson 1939,pp. 195-98). Insummarizing the
variousnew authorities giventheAdministration, Johnson (1939,p. 202) concludes, “The
President coulddoubleor triple bank reserves, hadcomplete discretion overthegoldvalue--and
consequently theforeignexchange value--of thedollar, andcouldestablishbimetallism by
proclamation, inotherwords,hecouldcompletely refashion themonetary systemofthecountry,
andthesolecriteriarequired were hisownsubjective evaluations ofthesituation.”
Organizational changes tothe FederalReserve System mayhave alsocontributed tothe
Fed’swillingness to accept theAdministration’s desiredmonetary policy. The authorsofthe
FederalReserveActagreedthattheFederalReserve Systemshould not be a“centralbank”on
theEuropean model, but afederal system ofsemi-autonomous Reserve Banks withan
overseeing board.Dissatisfaction withthesubsequentperformance oftheFederalReserve, both
duringthe1920sandduring1929-33, ledto reforms thatenhanced theauthority oftheFederal
ReserveBoardattheexpenseofthe ReserveBanks. Manner Ecclesacceptedthechairmanship
oftheFederalReserveBoardin1933withtheunderstanding thathewouldhavefreedomto

Reserve Bank ofNewYork,whichheviewedas aninstrument oftheprivate interests ofNew
Yorkbankers,andmeasures to ensure oversight andcoordination oftheactivities oftheregional
Reserve Banks in pursuitofthe national interest(Eccles 1966,pp.170-72).
UnderEccles’ plan, whichwaslargelyadopted by theBanking Actof1935,theBoardof
Governors was given substantial control overopen-marketoperations andFederalReserveBank
discount rates. The FederalOpenMarketCommittee (FOMC)was reconstituted to include all
sevenmembers oftheBoardofGovernors andjustfiveofthetwelve ReserveBankpresidents.’°
Thelegislation therebyincreased theauthority andstatureoftheFederalReserve officials
locatedinWashington andappointed by the President. Ontheotherhand,italsosoughttolimit
theinfluence ofthePresident by removing the Secretary oftheTreasury andComptroller ofthe
Currency asexofficio FOMC members. With his reforms,Ecclesintendedthatmonetary policy
makingwouldbemadebyprofessionals whoseallegiance wassolelytothenationalinterest.
These changes, however,increased politicalpressures on theFedatthesametimethat
establishment oftheExchange Stabilization Fundandothermeasures increased the
Administration’s powertoconductmonetary policy. Consequently, thesereformsshiftedpower
away fromthe Fed towardtheTreasury, andpromoted an inflationbias in monetary policy.
ThePost-War Monetary Regime
From1933to 1951,the FederalReserve Systemwas largely subordinate totheTreasury
intheconductofmonetary policy. The Fed increased reserverequirements in1936and1937to
absorb some ofthelargevolumeofexcessreserves that memberbankshadbuilt-up. A
subsequent increase in government securityyieldsangeredTreasury officials, however, andthe
~°TheBankingActof1935alsochangedthe titlesofthechiefexecutive officersoftheFederalReserve
Banksfromthemoreprestigious “Governor” to“President,” while discontinuingthe FederalReserve
BoardinfavoroftheBoardofGovernors, whosemembers allheldthetitle“Governor.” TheBoardof
Governors was alsoauthorized toapprovetheappointments ofFederalReserve Bank presidents and first
vicepresidents, andtogenerally supervise Reserve Bank operations.


4/14/97 18
Fed was forced to makeopen-marketpurchases andeventually reversesomeofthe change in
reserverequirements.
DuringWorldWarII,theFedagreedtopreventgovernment securityyieldsfromrising
abovepredetermined levels. The Fed remained an instrument ofdebtmanagement until 1951,
whenrising inflation causedFedofficials to arguefor anindependentmonetary policy.
Negotiations betweentheFedandTreasuryproduced theAccordofMarch1951, inwhichthe
Treasury agreed thatthe prices ofgovernment securities shouldbe permitted tofindtheirmarket
levelsandthe FedagreedtobemindfulofTreasury debtfinancing in carryingout itsmonetary
policies. Tacitly, theFedacceptedstability ofgovernment securities prices as an objective of
monetary policy. In particular, theFedfollowedapolicyknownas“evenkeel” inwhichit
limitedfluctuations in Treasury bill yields aroundTreasury issuing dates.
The Bretton Woods agreements of1944established theinternational monetary regime
underwhichtheFedoperatedinthepost-warera.”FromtheendofWorldWarIIthrough
1958,international tradeandcapitalmovements tookplacetotheextentpermitted byexchange
andcapitalcontrols, withinternationalpayments settledby means ofbilateralagreements among
countries. Earlyon, European countries ranlargecurrent account deficits andtheworldsuffered
froma“dollarshortage.” Americaneconomic strengthandstability, along withtheMarshall
Planandothercooperative efforts,causedthedollarto emergeas the keycurrencyofthe
internationalpayments system.As the1950sprogressed, Europestrengthenedeconomically and
severalcountries ran substantial current account surpluses. The main westernEuropean
currencies becameconvertible intodollarsforcurrent accounttransactions in1959(various
capitalcontrolsremained). The UnitedStates,inturn,maintainedconvertibility ofthedollar
intogoldatthefixedpriceof$35per ounce. Bretton Woods was thus agold-exchange standard,

asitsinterwarpredecessorhad been. However, the mechanism ofdollarconvertibility under
Bretton Woods was fundamentally differentfromthe mechanism ofthepre-Great Depression
goldstandard,andthe new mechanism explainshowtheUnitedStatescouldconductan
inflationary monetary policywhilemaintaining afixedexchange ratebetweenthedollarand
gold.
Unlikethegoldstandardas itexisted before 1933,under theBrettonWoodsSystem, the
balanceofpayments couldexertmonetarydiscipline onlyto theextentpermitted bycentral
banksthemselves. Thismechanism reflectedafundamental shiftin ideology, from onethatsaw
maintaining goldconvertibility as paramount forlong-runprosperity, to anideology thatviewed
fixedexchange ratesandgoldconvertibility as desirable, but not so important as to sacrifice
short-run economic stabilityin defense oftheinternational system.Discretionary monetary
policy --“managed money” --waspermitted under Bretton Woods to adegreeneverbefore
achieved under agoldstandard.’2
UnderBrettonWoods, American balanceofpayments deficits(surpluses) wouldbe

American Inflation
TheBretton Woods System collapsed becausethedollarshortageofthel950swas
replaced byadollar glut inthe1960s. TheFederalReservepursuedamonetary policythat
contained inflationthroughout muchofthedecadefollowingtheFed-TreasuryAccord ofMarch
1951. Asillustrated inFigure 2,during the1950s,thegrowth rate ofMl(which consistsmainly
ofcommercial bank demanddeposits and currencyheldby the public) generally movedopposite
totherateofinflation (asmeasured herebytheConsumer Price Index).’5Inflation controlwas
notthesoleobjectiveofmonetary policyduringthel950s,butdidgenerally coincidewiththe
Fed’s other objectives oflimiting fluctuations innational output andemployment andpreserving
stability ofthegovernmentsecurities market.

becauseofflaws inits operating strategyasbecauseofadesiretopursueobjectivesother than
inflationcontrol.
Theoperatingframework ofFederalReservepolicy inthe 1950sand1960swas much
likethatwhichBenjamin Stronghaddescribed inthe 1920s.Thatstrategywasflawed because it
permitted destabilizingfluctuations inthe supply ofmoney. Ibelieve thishelpsexplainwhyFed
officials wereable to convincethemselves thattheir policieswerepromoting recovery from the
Depression wheninfacttheywerepermitting acontractionary declinein themoneystock
(Wheelock, 1991).Similarly,the Fed’suseofthisoperating strategyinthe1960sexplainshow
Fedofficials couldarguethatpolicywas “leaningagainst the wind”ofinflationdespite
accelerating moneysupplygrowth.
The Fed’s interwar-era policy strategy, anditspost-Accord reincarnation, focused on the
levelsofmarketinterest ratesandthenetborrowed, or“free,”reservesofcommercial banks.
Fedofficials engagedinopen-marketoperations toaltertheleveloffreereserves, whichequals
thedifference betweenreserves that banks hold inexcessoflegalrequirements andreserves
borrowed fromthe Fed’s discountwindow. Throughfreereserves, theFedsoughttomanipulate
moneymarketinterest rates(Treasury billyields inthe early1960s,thefederalfundsrate later
on).Open-market purchases (sales) tendtoaddto(subtract from)thestockoffreereserves, and
anincrease (decrease) infree reserves wasviewed asaneasing (tightening) ofpolicy. The level
offreereserves is plottedalongside the rate ofinflationfor the periodfromtheAccord (March
1951) through December 1971inFigure3.TheFedtendedto reducefree reservestocombat
increasesininflation, andincrease free reserves wheninflation was declining. ThusFed
officials soughtto contractthe leveloffree reserves in response tothegenerally risingrateof
inflation ofthe1960s. Because market interest rates tended torise, Fed officialswerefurther
convinced thatpolicy was tight.


4/14/97 22
Many economists, especially monetarists,criticized the Fed’s policystrategybecause of
itstendency toexacerbate swings in moneysupply growth.’6Asillustrated inFigure 4,money
supply growth acceleratedthroughout muchofthe1960s,evenasFedofficialsratcheted down
thelevel offreereserves. Theevidence therefore doesnotindicatethatFedofficials lacked
concern for inflation orfailed toattempt tocheckthe rising pricelevel.Nevertheless, the Fed’s
policypermitted themoneysupplyto riseataninflationary rate.
TheFederalReserve was notpowerless to haltthe rising inflation, andFedofficials
understood that inflationwascontributing totheAmerican balanceofpayments deficitand
threatening thegoldstandard. Still,under the Bretton Woods System, U.S. policymakersdid
nothave tomake price stability thesole, oreven primary, objective ofmonetary policy aslong
asothercountries werewilling to holdthegrowingsupplyofdollarsavailable onworldmarkets.
Foreigncentral banksdidforbearforatime,particularly sincethedollarwas thekeycurrencyof
theinternationalpayments system. This gavetheUnitedStatesbreathing room --not,asit
turned out, to correctitsbalance ofpayments deficit,but topursueotherpolicy goalswhile
inflationworsened andthe collapse ofBretton Woods becameinevitable.
TheMonetary Policy Legacy oftheGreat Depression
TheFederalReserve stumbledinto an inflationary monetary policyintheearly1960s
because,absentdiscipline exertedby balance ofpayments deficits, policymakerswereable to
pursueotherobjectives, namelyemployment growthandlow interestrates on government debt.
With itsfocuson free reserves andinterest rates, theFed’soperating framework tendedtocause
moneysupplygrowthtoaccelerate ataninflationary pace aseconomic activityexpanded.
BecausetheFedhadused much the same operating framework beforetheDepression, thiscause
ofinflationary policyduringthe1960s was not a result oftheDepression havingoccurred.

Keynesian Macroeconomics andMonetary PolicyMaking
Muchofthe“inflationary bias”inmonetary policyduringthe1960scan,however, be
attributed to changedinstitutions andeconomic policyideologycaused by theGreatDepression.
Keynesian macroeconomics anditsinfluence oneconomic policy making was an important
ideological productofthe GreatDepression. The influence ofKeynesianeconomic ideas on
policy making duringthe1960shasreceivedconsiderable attention (e.g.,DeLong, 1995),with
Lucas (1980,p. 704) writingthatoneofthe“mainfeaturesoftheKeynesian Revolution andthe
neoclassical synthesis intowhichitevolvedintheUnitedStates ...[was] the onset ofthe Great
Depression andtheconsequent shiftofattentionfromexplaining arecurrentpatternofupsand
downstoexplaining aneconomy apparently stuck inan interminable down.”
Keynesian-oriented policymakersbelievedthatmonetary andfiscalpolicycould
reliablyincreaseaggregate demandandemployment alongastablePhillipscurve.Centralto
discussions ofmonetary policyamongFederalReserve officials was the perceived tradeoffof
unemployment andinflation. AsFederalReserveGovernor ShermanMaiselexplained it,“There
isatrade-off betweenidlemenandamorestablevaluefor thedollar. Aconscious decision
must bemade astohowmuch unemployment andlossofoutput must bemade inorder toget
smaller price rises”(Maisel, 1973, p.14). Maisel added “that atleastsome oftheCommittee’s
differences onpolicyreflected differences inbasicvaluejudgments regarding therelative
importance ofvariousconflicting goals --forexample, regarding the appropriate trade-off
betweenemployment andpricestability” (FOMCMinutes, October20,1970,p.41).’~
Maisel’sviews were widely sharedamong his colleagues, including ArthurBurns,who
becameChairman oftheFederalReserveBoardofGovernors in 1970.Burnsconsistently was
‘~TheMinutesoftheFederalOpenMarketCommittee arenotverbatimtranscriptions ofFOMC meetings.

among those favoringan easymonetary policyin1970and1971,andoftencitedthe
consequences ofmonetary policyforemployment. At an FOMC meetingonMarch9,1971,for
example, MaiselreadaNewYorkTimes editorial totheeffectthat“anyonewhowasapartyto
theuseofunemployment tocombatinflationhadamoraldutytoleadtheway,eitherby
relinquishing his jobor bycontributing his incometo thesupport oftheinvoluntarily
unemployed.” Burns repliedthat“hewantedto endorse Mr.Maisel’s ...comments,” thatthe
ongoingeconomic recovery was“fragile”andthat“rising[interest] ratescouldprove fatal tothe
prospects forrecovery” (FOMC Minutes,March 9,1971, pp.44~49)~18
Toavoidconfronting theinflation-unemployment tradeoff,Burns,likemanyofhisFed
colleagues, advocated wageandpricecontrols sothat monetary policy couldfocus onfighting
unemployment. Moreover, Burnsfrequently arguedthatinflation associated withincreases in
wagesandotherproduction costs, asopposedtoexcessive monetary growth, should not be
fought with tight monetary policy. AtanFOMC meeting onJune 8,1971, forexample, he
argued that“Monetary policycoulddoverylittle to arrestan inflationthatrestedsoheavilyon
wage-cost pressures.... Amuchhigherrateofunemployment produced bymonetary policy
wouldnot moderate suchpressures appreciably.... He intendedto continuetopress[the
Administration] hard foraneffective incomespolicy”(FOMCMinutes, June 8,1971, p.51).
BurnsandotherFedofficialsfrequently arguedthatmonetary policy could noteffectively
controlinflation, butthatfiscalpolicyandwageandpricecontrolscouldbetter accomplish the
task.Monetary policy, on theotherhand, should prevent interest ratesfromrising andchoking
offeconomic growth. Inarguingagainst apolicytightening in April 1971,Burnscontended that
anyincrease in long-term interestrateswouldslowthe economy “andthenationmight thenenter

onalong period ofeconomic stagnation. The FederalReservecouldnotpermitthat
development” (FOMCMinutes, April 6,1971, p.56).
Duringthel960sand1970s,Fedofficialsbelievedthatpolicyactionstopushdown
interestrates couldpromoteoutputandemployment growth.Suchactionwould notnecessarily
causeinflation, theyargued,andifit did, inflationwas an acceptable costofhighemployment.
Moreover, wageandpricecontrolscouldlimitinflation. It ismyviewthatFederalReserve
policymakerswereno lessconcerned about the unemployed andtheprospects foreconomic
growthduringtheGreatDepression. Theirviews about howmonetary policycould beused to
fostergrowth,however, werealmostdiametrically opposedto thoseofFedofficialsinthe1960s
andearly1970s.
IntheDepression, acommonviewamongFedofficials was thatpumping liquidity into
theeconomy would onlyprolongtheDepression bydelaying theadjustments towagesand
prices thattheysawasnecessary forarecovery tobegin. Oneexample ofthispoint ofview is
evident inthe comments ofWilliamMcChesney Martin,Governor oftheFederalReserveBank
ofSt.LouisduringtheDepressionand fatherofWilliamMcChesney Martin,Jr.,theFederal
Reserve Board’s Chairman from 1951 to1970. Inearly 1930, Martin argued,
Icannot seehow thesituationcanbebenefited by putting fiftymillionsof
dollars, or,infact,anyotheramount, intothe general marketatthistime.... The
reason thatmore money isnot being used is because itisnot needed, andwhen
there isalreadysufficient moneyto meettheexpressed needs, itseems tome
unwise artificially toaddtotheamountalreadysufficient ...becausebasedona
redundancy ofmoneyratherthanon actualneeds maybe hazardous. (quotedby
Chandler, 1971, p.142)
Asimilar viewwasexpressed by George Norris,Governor oftheFederalReserve Bankof
Philadelphia:
Webelievethatthecorrection mustcomeabout throughreducedproduction,
reducedinventories, thegradualreduction ofconsumer credit,theliquidation of
securityloans,andthe accumulation ofsavings through theexercise ofthrift....
Wehavebeen putting out credit ina period ofdepression, whenitwas not
wantedandcouldnot beused. (quotedby Chandler, 1971,p.137).


4/14/97 26
The Governor oftheFederalReserve BankofSanFrancisco, JohnCalkins, also arguedagainst
tryingtostimulate theeconomy by lowering interest rates: “Withcreditcheapandredundant we
donotbelievethatbusiness recovery will beaccelerated by making credit cheaperandmore
redundant” (quotedby Friedman andSchwartz, 1963, p.372).
The views ofMartin, Norris andCalkinswerenotatypicalamong FederalReserve
officialsduringthe1930s.Norwasitunusualforgovernment officialsoutsideoftheFederal
Reserve to hold similarviews. Secretary oftheTreasury AndrewMellon,forexample, believed
thatthebestmedicine fortheDepression was to “Liquidate labor, liquidate stocks,liquidatethe
farmers,liquidatereal estate ...purgetherottenness outofthe system” (quotedbyEichengreen,
1992,p.251).Suchaprescription couldhardlybecalled“Keynesian.”
PoliticalPressures on theFed
Themacroeconomic modelusedbyFederalReserveofficials duringthe1960sand
l970swas quite differentfromthatusedin theearly1930s.Sotoo was the extenttowhichthe
FederalReserve waspressured byothergovernment officials.
Although theFederal Reserve hasneverbeenatruly“independent” centralbank,certain
institutional changesoccurring as aresultofthe Great Depressionsubjected theFedtogreater
politicalpressure, whileatthe sametimeincreasing the opportunity for theFedtomonetize
fiscal deficits. Together these changes addedan inflation biastomonetary policy.
The Glass-Steagall Actof1932, asnotedpreviously, permitted U.S.Government
securities to serve as partial backingforFederalReservemonetaryliabilities. Thusmonetization
offiscaldeficits couldoccur eveniftheFedheldnoexcess gold orcommercial paper reserves.
Inthe1930s,specialauthorities given by Congress to thePresident to fixthevalueofthedollar
interms ofgold,tomonetize silver,tobuyandsell foreign exchange andeventoorderthe
Federal Reserve tomakeopen-marketpurchases allweakened the Fed’s ability to conductan
independentmonetary policy.Inaddition, changesto thestructureoftheFederalReserve


4/14/97 27
Systemitselfincreased theconcentration ofpowerwithin the Fed inthe handsofgovernment
appointees located in Washington.
Although theFed-Treasury Accordof1951returnedameasureofindependence tothe
Fed, thelevel andstabilityofgovernment security yields remainedakeyfocusofmonetary
policy. Part oftheexplanation forthisfocus may restwiththe Korean andVietnamWars.The
Fedhadensuredplentifulandinexpensive funding forthe Treasury duringthetwoworldwars,
andtheFedmayhave soughtto limit increasesin government securityyieldsduringtheKorean
andVietnam episodes outofasenseofpatriotic duty.’9Abyproduct ofsuchapolicy,ofcourse,
wasafasterrate ofincrease in thesupplyofmoney.
NewDealchangestothe Fed’sinternal structure mayhave alsocontributed towardits
policyoflimitingincreases ininterestrates.Byreducingthe role ofFederal Reserve Bank
presidents infavoroftheBoardofGovernors, theBanking Act of1935subjected theFedto
greaterpolitical influence byconcentrating powerinthehands ofWashington-based officials
whoarepresidentialappointees. Politicalinfluence onmonetary policyhasbeenthesubjectof
extensive study(e.g.,Wooley, 1984;Havrilesky, 1993),andageneralconclusionseems to be
thatthe short, finite horizonofpolitical election cyclesgives politicians anincentive tofavor
moreexpansionary monetary policiesthandoes the public asawhole. To the extentthat
politicians are ableto getthemonetary policytheydesire, theresult is ahigherlong-runrateof
inflationthanwould otherwise occur.Thuscountries withlessindependent central banks tend to
havehigher inflation ratesthan countries withrelativelyindependent centralbanks.
Aninfamous example ofFederalReserveacquiescence topolitical pressurecame in
1972 when attherequestoftheAdministration ArthurBurnswas allegedtohaveincreased the
moneysupplygrowth rate to promotePresident Nixon’sreelection (seeWells, 1994for
~EvidenceofthisisgiveninCalomiris and Wheelock (1997).

discussion). Whetheror not such overtpressurewas exerted, it is clearthatunderbothBurns
andMartinpolitical considerations influenced thesetting ofmonetary policy. With the possible
exception ofNixon’sreelection, such pressurewas not overtly connected toelections, butrather
toconsideration oftheAdministration’s or Congress’ policypreferences. To theextentsuch
considerations influenced policyoutcomes, theywouldalmostalways havedone soon the side
ofpromoting inflation. 20
Monetary Policyandthe Balance ofPayments
TheFed’soperating strategy, desireto promotehighemployment, andpressures onthe
Fed tokeepinterestrateslowallgavemonetarypolicy abiastowardinflation. By themselves,
however, theycouldnothaveresultedinasustained inflationwithoutanaccommodating
internationalmonetary regime.Undertheclassical goldstandard, forexample, an inflationary
monetary policycould nothavebeen sustained. But, under Bretton Woods,sustained inflation
was possible aslongasforeigncentralbankswerewilling to holdthedollarstheyaccumulated
as aresultoftheAmericanpayments deficit,ratherthandemandpayment ingoldforthose
dollars.
Although theBretton Woods System provided someinsulation fordiscretionary
monetary policy,FederalReserve officials understood thattheUnitedStatescould not run a
balanceofpayments deficit indefinitely. But, Fedofficials were also waryofcombating a
balanceofpayments deficitwithpolicies that mightinterferewithothergoals. On oneoccasion,
~°Burnshadacloserelationship withNixonandclearly understood the monetarypolicy desiredbythe
Administration. Twoexamplesofthe interjection ofpolitical considerations intomonetarypolicy
discussionsoccurred atameetingoftheFOMCinOctober1970andJanuary 1971.On thefirstoccasion,
Burnssuggested thatcommittee membersconsiderthe‘judgments ofmembersofCongress, senior
officialsoftheAdministration, andothers”when attempting todetermine howhightheywerewillingtolet
the unemployment rateriseinfightinginflation(FOMCMinutes,October20,1970,p.41).Three
meetingslater,Burnstoldthecommittee that“TheAdministration’sconfidence intheSystemwas
weakening asaresultoftheshortfalls thathadoccurredintheratesofmoneygrowth.... Thecredibility of
theFederal Reserve wouldbe greatly strengthened ifitbecameapparentthatthe Committee was seeking to
makeupthe...shortfall” (FOMCMinutes,January12,1971,p. 37). SeeCalomiris and Wheelock(1997)
forexamplesofpoliticalpressure ontheFedwhenWilliamMartinwasFedchairman.


4/14/97 29
President AlfredHayesoftheFederalReserveBankofNewYork,arguedthat“Iwouldthink it
unwise to letthe goldoutflowitselfaffectourmonetary policydirectly, i.e., inthe way ofusing
atightening movedirectedspecifically towardstemming theflowandunrelated todomestic
economic developments”(FOMC Minutes, November 10,1958,p.14-15).Anothertime, a
Reserve Bank president expressed concernaboutthe balanceofpayments deficit,but was
reluctant toadvocateatighterpolicyforfearofdisrupting themarketforgovernment securities:
“Generally, he feltthat the courseofmonetary policyshouldbe movingtoward amore
restrictive posture. At thesame time, hewas quite concerned abouttheratepicturein the
governmentsecurities marketandtheproblems facing theTreasury in the future” (FOMC
Minutes,May5,1959, p.34).Thisreluctance to facesquarely goldoutflowsandabalanceof
payments deficit stands in marked contrast totheFed’sreactiontogoldoutflows in1931.At
thattime, Fed officials agreed thatmaintaining convertibility ofthedollarintogoldataconstant
price wasfundamental tolong-run economic stability, andtheywere willing totightenmonetary
policy inthemiddleofadepression topreservetheinternationalmonetary regime.Bycontrast,
inthe1950s and1960s, Fedofficials viewedthebalanceofpayments withconcern, butwere
hesitant to makeitthesole,oreventhe primary, focus ofpolicy. This changeinphilosophy,
attaching lessimportance to thegoldstandardrule andmoretodiscretionary policywas an
important legacyofthe GreatDepression.
Although Fedofficialswereunwilling to tightensufficiently to arrestthebalanceof
payments deficit,theydid seethedeficit as influencing their ability to promotedomestic
economic activity. Chairman Martin,forexample, arguedthat“IftheFederal Reserve got the
reputation offollowing acheapmoneypolicyjustfor thesake ofdoing so, peopleabroadwould
beencouraged tothinkthe System wasnotconcerned withthe balance ofpayments or the
soundness ofthedollar”(FOMCMinutes, December 13,1960, p.40). Martin alsoargued that

“Thebalanceofpayments problem ...was avitalfactorinthe unemployment situation. Foreign
capital was findingtheUnitedStateslessandless attractive, therewere pressures formovement
ofcapital abroad, andthiswashavingadeleteriouseffect on employment inthiscountry”
(FOMCMinutes, March 6,1962, p.56).
Fedofficialsalsounderstood thatthe balance ofpayments deficitstemmed from
differences in themacroeconomic policiesofdifferent countries. AtaFOMCmeetingin1959,a
Fedstaffmember reported that“Thenetresultofattempts in thiscountrytovalidateourwage
andpricepoliciesthroughmonetary expansion could succeedonlyifwecouldinflate the whole
world.” The staffmemberwenton toargue thatexpansionarymonetary andfiscalpolicycould
“priceUnitedStates’ goodsout ofworldmarkets” becauseofficialsofothercountries, notably
Germany andTheNetherlands, surelywould not permitinflation in theirdomestic prices
(FOMCMinutes, May5,1959,p. 14).Thesameofficial,however, wasunwilling toblame
monetary policyalonefor thebalanceofpayments deficit. In arguingthatgoldoutflows“call
foragenerallyrestrictive creditpolicy ...more effective corrections ...would bemoves toreduce
thebudgetary deficitandthe checking ofpricerisesduetowageandothercostincreases”
(FOMCMinutes,October 21,1958).
TheFed’sunwillingness to tightensufficiently to stem thebalanceofpayments deficit
ledit toconsiderotheractions it might take. One oftheearliestofthepoliciesintended to
restoreexternalbalancewas “OperationTwist”--an attempt to raise short-term interestrateshigh
enoughtoattractforeigncapital, while keepinglong-term interestrateslowenoughtofavor
domestic expansion.
Otherpolicies intended tocorrectinternationalpayments imbalances without slowing
domestic activity included agreements with foreign central banks toforebearfromdemanding
gold, intervention inforeign exchange markets, theissuance offoreign currency-denominated
U.S. bonds (“Roosabonds”), requestsofearlyrepaymentby foreigngovernments ofdebts tothe


4/14/97 31
U.S.Government, the removal ofinterestrateceilings on U.S. banktime deposits, capital
outflowconstraints imposedin theUnitedStates,andchanges in U.S.taxtreatment offoreign
earnings. Balanceofpayments deficitscontinued, however, andthelong-term feasibility ofthe
existingdollargold-exchange standardgrewincreasingly doubtful.
The Collapse ofBretton Woods
WhenArthurBurnstookoveraschairmanoftheFed’s BoardofGovernors inearly
1970,the U.S.economy wasslidingtoward arecession, the inflation rate stoodat6.5percent
(firstquarter average annualized rateofCPI inflation), andthe U.S.balanceofpayments had
beenindeficitnearlyeveryyearsincethelate1950s.Athisfirstmeeting,Burnsannounced that
“inhisjudgment, economic developments hadreachedapointatwhicharethinking ofmonetary
policywas inorder” (FOMC Minutes, February 10,1970,p.3). Itquickly became apparentthat
Burnswouldmake avoidance ofarecession hisfirstpriority. Against threedissents,theFederal
OpenMarketCommittee votedtoeasemonetary policy atthatmeeting. Oneofthedissenting
votes came from AndrewBrimmer, whoexpressed thehopethat “the Committeewould notlose
sightofthehighlyunfavorable outlookforthebalanceofpayments andwouldgivethepayments
balancesomewhat greaterthancustomary weightinformulating policyoverthenearterm”(ibid,
p.59).
FederalOpenMarketCommittee meetings usuallybeginwithanalysisofeconomic
conditions by Fed staffmembers, andduring1970and1971,thestafffrequently expressed
pessimism aboutthebalanceofpayments deficit.Following the staffreports,thereusuallywasa
report from aFedgovernor, oftenDewey Daane,whoattendedaregular meeting ofcentralbank
officials inEurope. The U.S. payments deficitwasaprincipal topic atthosemeetings, withthe
Europeans frequently questioning American resolvetocontrol inflation(see, e.g., FOMC
Minutes, June 23, 1970).The balance ofpayments seemsto have hadlimitedimpacton FOMC


4/14/97 32
deliberations,however, becauseafterhearingthesummary ofthe European meeting,the
Committee wouldreviewdomestic economicconditions anddiscussthepolicydirective, usually
withlittle ornoreference tothebalanceofpayments.
At the FOMC meetingofOctober20, 1970,theFedstaffgave aparticularly lengthyand
pessimistic reporton thebalanceofpayment. Following the report, Burns“said hecouldadd
onewordofreassurance. Workon thebalanceofpayments problemwas going forward actively,
andhewasconfident thatadequate measures forgrappling withtheproblemcouldbedevised”
(FOMCMinutes,October20,1970,p.21).Fromthiscomment, itis clearthatBurnsviewedthe
balanceofpayments deficitasaproblemthatcouldbecontrolled effectively withoutmonetary
policyaction. Moreover, the comment reflects the factthatthe Treasury, especially
Undersecretary PaulVolker,wastakingthe leadin devising America’sinternational economic
policy.
Despitetheseeminglackofinfluence ofthebalanceofpayments deficitonFederal
Reservepolicy,someoftheFed’sstaff aswellas theoccasional governor, warnedaboutthe
worseningpayments deficit.At anFOMC meetingon June 23, 1970, thefirstvicepresident of
theNewYorkFedarguedthat“Aconvincing andsustained attackondomestic inflationremains
essentialforimproving ourbalanceofpayments andstrengtheningconfidence inthedollar”
(FOMCMinutes,June23,1970,p.57).Onanotheroccasion, AlfredHayes,President ofthe
NewYorkFednotedthat“astiffpriceisbeingpaidfor theeasing ofmoneymarket conditions in
theUnitedStates.... International conditionsunderline theneedforgivinghighpriorityto the
inflationproblem” (FOMCMinutes, September 15,1970,pp.43-44). But,Governor Maisel
repliedthat
Itwouldbeimproper to assumethat balanceofpayments considerationsshould
be aconstraint on [policy]. Ifthebalanceofpayments remained unsatisfactory
withdemandstill farbelownormal, that wouldappearto be an indication of
basicstructuralproblems inthebalanceofpayments sphere.TheCommittee
shouldbe workingtocorrectthose structuralimbalances ratherthanassuminga


4/14/97 33
posturewhichtraded offlossesofincome,output,andjobsinanattemptto
offsetbasicstructural defects inthe balanceofpayments sphere. (ibid. p. 46)
ArthurBurnsaddedthat “Hebelievedthatbalanceofpayments considerations should not
preventtheCommittee fromtakingthepolicyactions it felt requiredby thedomestic economy”
(ibid.p.65).Laterinthesamemeeting Burns advocated “specialmeasures,”presumably capital
controlsor similarmeasures, to dealwith the balanceofpayments deficit(ibid,p.81). Burns
reiterated thisviewonFebruary 9,1971:“Chairman Burnscommented thatwhiletheSystem
wasfacedwithinternational aswellasdomesticproblems, thelatterwerethemorepressing.
Moreover, special tools were available fordealingwiththeformer”(FOMC Minutes, February 9,
1971,p. 92).
Thebalanceofpayments deficit grewincreasingly worse inearly1971,andthe Fed’s
staffwarnings becamestronger. At the MarchFOMCmeeting,aFedstaffmember warned that
“Sooner or later —andhesuspected thatitwouldbesooner --thecentralbankcomplaints now
beingvoicedprivately [about theirbuild-upofdollarbalances] wouldbecomeknown to the
market,whichmight thendecidetoprotectitselfagainsttheriskofasuddenbreakinthe
structureofexchange parities”(FOMCMinutes,March9,1971,p. 22).Anotherstaffmember
reportedthat
1)thebalance ofpayments deficit inthe firsttwo months ofthisyearwas
enormous; [and]2) themonetary aggregates havebeengrowingveryrapidly.
Whatconnectsthesetwo setsoffacts istheverysteepdeclineinshort-term
interestrates. It isnot surprising, therefore,that the short-term capital outflow
hasbeenextremely large.... Considerable reluctance hasbeenbuilt upabroad,
especially amongfmancialofficialsinEurope,over whattheyregardasan
undermining oftheirownmonetary policiesresulting fromthemassiveshort-
term capital outflows fromtheUnitedStatesandfromthesteep declineinshort-
term rates. Theimpression exists that ...theUnitedStateshascompletely
ignoredtheeffects its policiesarehavingon therestofthe world. (ibid, pp. 28-
29)
As theyear1971progressed,the international payments crisis worsened. AttheFOMC
meetingofMay11,NewYorkFedpresident Hayesremarked that “We are ...inthemidstofan


4/14/97 34
internationalmonetary crisis.... Avoteofno confidence inthe dollarhasbeentakenby several
centralbanks”(FOMCMinutes, May11,1971,p.53).Hayesalsoreportedthatthedirectorsof
theFederal Reserve Bank ofNewYorkhadvotedto increase the Bank’s discount rateby1/2
point,the same step takeninresponse to aflightfromthedollarinOctober1931:
The directors felt in thismajorinternational crisistherewasnothingthe System
coulddothatwouldbemoreuseful andmoretimelythantogiveanovertsignal
ofourconcernandourwillingness tomove quickly towardnarrowing the
interestrate spreadwhichwasamajorcauseofthedifficulty.... While
recognizing therisksinvolved inageneral increase in domestic interestrates,
theyfeltthatthoseriskswere outweighed byinternationalconditions. (ibid,pp.
55-56)
TheBoardofGovernors turneddowntheNewYorkBank’srequestforadiscountrate
increase, citing weakness inthe domestic economy, the adverse effects ofhigher interest rateson
themortgage marketandthemarketforstateandlocalgovernment debt,andthelikely
instability that adiscountratehikewouldcausein all financial markets. At thepriorFOMC
meeting, Burns seemtohavepredicted theNewYorkBank’srequestforadiscountrate increase
whenhe relayedthat“He hadavividrecollection ofdevelopments in 1931, whentheFederal
Reservehadraisedits discountrateandacted to stiffen short-term ratesbecauseofabalanceof
payments problem, andanincipient [domesticeconomic] recoveryhadbeencutoff”(FOMC
Minutes, April6,1971,p.56).For Burns, thelessonof1931was to put thedomestic economy
first,aheadofthebalanceofpayments andpreservation ofthegoldstandard.
Conclusion
Thefailuresofeconomic policy,especially monetary policy, during theGreat
Depression produced severalsignificant institutional andideological changesinthemonetary
policy regime. Notsurprisingly, becausemonetary policywas associated withdeflation and
contraction during1929-33,the newregime included featuresthatgavepolicyan inflationbias.
Thosefeaturesincludedbothanewavenue for monetizing government debtandincreased


4/14/97 35
political control ofFederalReserve policy. The Great Depression alsoputtheneweconomics of
Keynes, with its emphasis ongovernment management ofaggregate demand,into the
professional andpolicymainstream.
The most fundamental legacyofthe Great Depression formonetary policy,however,
concerned theinternational goldstandard. Althoughgovernments interferedwith theoperation
ofthegoldstandardbefore 1933, andanunsettled questionamongeconomic historians isthe
extenttowhichalaissez-faire’ goldstandardwouldhaveprovedmorestable,akeylessontaken
from theGreat Depression was thatthe internationalmonetary systemrequiredactive
management ofgovernment officials. Faiththatthegoldstandardwouldensureprosperity was
destroyed, aswasanynotionthatadisasterworsethantheDepression would result ifthegold
standard was abandoned. Beginning in 1933,andcontinuing atleast tothe 1970s,thedominant
ideologywas thatagoldstandardandfixedexchange rates aredesirable, but notworth
sacrificing highemployment to maintain. Thischange in attitude,andtheinstitutional changes
accompanying it,largelyexplains theinflationary monetary policyofthel960sandearly1970s,
aswellasthedecisiontoabandongoldandfixedexchange ratesin1971-73.
Sincethe l970s,thependulum hasswungaway from inflationarymonetary policy
somewhat. The costs ofhighinflationandthe seeming inabilityofaggregate demandpolicyto
maintain fullemployment helpedpromote NewClassical macroeconomics andcauseda
rethinking oftheappropriate goals ofmonetary policyamong government officials. Several
countries nowspecifyinflationtargetsfortheircentralbanks,andhaveformallyadopted price
stabilityas the paramount objective formonetary policy. The institutional environment of
monetary policyintheUnitedStates,however, has notchangedsince1973,whenfixed
exchange rateswere abandoned. The legacyofthe Great Depression formonetary policy was in
causinganinstitutional andideological shifttoa managed, discretionarymonetary regime. The
fundamentals ofthisregimeremain inplace today.
