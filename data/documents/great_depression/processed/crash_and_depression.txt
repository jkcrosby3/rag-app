Effects of the Great Crash, 1929
Chapter 15, Section 1


The Great Depression
•The economic contraction that began with the Great 
Crash triggered the most severe economic downturn 
in the nation’s history —the Great Depression .
•The Great Depression lasted from 1929 until the 
United States entered World War II in 1941.
•The stock market crash of 1929 did not cause the 
Great Depression.  Rather, both the Great Crash and 
the Depression were the result of deep underlying 
problems with the country’s economy.Chapter 15, Section 1


The prosperous economy of the 1920s lacked a firm base.
The nation’s wealth was unevenly distributed.  Those who had the 
most tended to save or invest rather than buy goods.
Industry produced more goods than most consumers wanted or 
could afford.An Unstable 
Economy
Speculators bought stocks with borrowed money and then 
pledged those stocks as collateral to buy more stocks.
The stock market boom was based on borrowed money.Overspeculation
During the 1920s, the Federal Reserve System cut interest rates to 
assist economic growth.
In 1929, it limited the money supply to discourage lending.
As a result, there was too little money in circulation to help the 
economy after the Great Crash.Government 
Policies

•Sometimes the homeless built shacks of tar paper or scrap 
material.  These shanty town settlements came to be called 
Hoovervilles .
•Farm families suffered from low crop prices.
•As a result of a severe drought and farming practices that 
removed protective prairie grasses, dust storms ravaged the 
central and southern Great Plains region.  This area, stripped of 
its natural soil, was reduced to dust and became known as the 
Dust Bowl .
•The combination of the terrible weather and low prices caused 
about 60 percent of Dust Bowl families to lose their farms.Chapter 15, Section 2

Surviving the Great Depression

•Throughout the country, people pulled together to help one 
another.
•Neighbors in difficult circumstances helped those they saw 
as worse off than themselves.
•When banks foreclosed on a farm, neighboring farmers 
would bid pennies on land and machines, which they would 
then return to the original owners. These sales became 
known as penny auctions .
•Some Americans called for radical political and economic 
change.  They believed that a fairer distribution of wealth 
would help to end the hard times.
•Jokes and humor helped many people to fight everyday 
despair. Chapter 15, Section 3


In February 1933, Congress passed the Twenty -first 
Amendment , which repealed the eighteenth amendment 
prohibiting the sale of alcohol.Prohibition Is 
Repealed
2,500 to 4,000 people worked on the construction.

The Election of 1932
•How did President Hoover respond to the Great 
Depression?
•What did Roosevelt mean when he offered Americans 
a “New Deal”?
•Why was the election of 1932 a significant turning 
point for American politics?Chapter 15, Section 4


Hoover’s Limited Strategy
•Hoover convinced business leaders to help maintain public confidence in 
the economy.
•To protect domestic industries, Congress passed the Hawley -Smoot tariff , 
the highest import tax in history.  European countries also raised their 
tariffs, and international trade suffered a slowdown.
•Hoover set up the Reconstruction Finance Corporation (RFC) , which gave 
government credit to banks, industries, railroads, and insurance 
companies.  The theory was that prosperity at the top would help the 
economy as a whole.  Many Americans saw it as helping bankers and big 
businessmen, while ordinary people went hungry.
•Hoover did not support federal public assistance because he believed it 
would destroy people’s self -respect and create a large bureaucracy.
•Finally, public opinion soured for Hoover when he called the United States 
Army to disband a protest of 20,000 unemployed World War I veterans 
called the Bonus Army . Chapter 15, Section 4


A ―New Deal‖ for America
•FDR promised a New Deal for the American people.
•He was ready to experiment with government roles in 
an effort to end the Depression.
•As governor of New York, Roosevelt had set up an 
unemployment commission and a relief agency.
•FDR’s wife, Eleanor, was an experienced social 
reformer.  She worked for public housing legislation, 
state government reform, birth control, and better 
conditions for working women.
•When the Roosevelts campaigned for the presidency, 
they brought their ideas for political action with them.Chapter 15, Section 4


The Election of 1932

should not try to fix people’s 
problems.
•Argued that federal aid and

urban workers, coal miners, and
