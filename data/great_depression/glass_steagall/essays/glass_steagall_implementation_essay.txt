# Implementing the Glass-Steagall Act: A Firewall for Financial Stability

## Introduction

The catastrophic financial collapse that precipitated the Great Depression has revealed fundamental flaws in our banking system that demand immediate structural reform. The collapse of nearly 9,000 banks between 1930 and 1933 has wiped out the savings of millions of Americans and paralyzed our economy. This unprecedented crisis demonstrates that allowing commercial banks to engage in speculative securities activities creates an inherently unstable financial system that jeopardizes our entire economic infrastructure. The proposed Glass-Steagall Act addresses these vulnerabilities by establishing a critical separation between commercial and investment banking activities—a separation that is not merely advisable but essential for preventing future economic disasters.

## The Dangers of Combined Banking Functions

The evidence from our recent financial collapse clearly demonstrates the hazards of permitting commercial banks to engage in investment banking activities. When banks use depositors' funds for high-risk securities investments, they create a dangerous commingling of fundamentally different financial functions. As Kroszner and Rajan (1994) have documented in their comprehensive study of pre-Depression banking, this combination creates inherent conflicts of interest that undermine sound financial decision-making. Commercial bankers face irresistible temptations to underwrite unsound securities when they can profit from both the underwriting fees and the use of these securities to repay bank loans.

Moreover, the speculative culture of investment banking inevitably infiltrates the traditionally conservative approach of commercial banking when both functions exist within the same institution. This cultural shift leads to excessive risk-taking with deposits that should be safeguarded for the stability of our payment system and the security of depositors' funds. The result, as we have witnessed, is a banking system prone to periodic crises that devastate not only the financial sector but the broader economy.

## Key Provisions and Their Rationale

The Glass-Steagall Act addresses these structural vulnerabilities through several critical provisions. First and foremost, it prohibits commercial banks from engaging in investment activities, effectively separating these two distinct banking functions. This separation creates a firewall that prevents the contagion of risk from speculative securities activities to the commercial banking system that forms the backbone of our economy.

Second, the Act establishes the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) to provide deposit insurance, guaranteeing bank deposits up to a specified amount. This provision directly addresses the crisis of confidence that has led to destructive bank runs. By assuring depositors that their funds are secure regardless of an individual bank's condition, we can prevent the panic-driven withdrawals that have accelerated bank failures and deepened our economic crisis.

Third, Regulation Q provisions prohibit banks from paying interest on demand deposits and authorize the Federal Reserve to set interest rate ceilings on time deposits. These measures discourage destructive competition for deposits that pushed banks toward increasingly risky investments to cover higher interest payments—a significant factor in the banking crisis.

Finally, the Act limits the activities of bank holding companies to banking and closely related activities, preventing the formation of complex financial structures designed to circumvent the separation of banking functions.

## Implementation and Enforcement Framework

Effective implementation of the Glass-Steagall Act requires a robust regulatory framework with clear lines of authority. The Act will be enforced by multiple regulatory agencies working in coordination:

- The Federal Reserve Board will oversee the overall banking system and enforce key provisions
- The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency will supervise national banks
- The newly established FDIC will administer deposit insurance and monitor bank safety
- The Securities and Exchange Commission (established in 1934) will regulate securities markets

This multi-agency approach provides comprehensive oversight while allowing specialized expertise in different aspects of financial regulation. The implementation process will include a reasonable transition period for banks to divest prohibited securities activities, minimizing market disruption while firmly establishing the new structural safeguards.

## Long-term Benefits for Economic Stability

Implementing the Glass-Steagall Act is not merely responding to past failures but proactively building a financial architecture that will support sustainable economic growth for generations to come. The stability this reform provides will ultimately benefit all sectors of the economy by ensuring that the banking system remains a reliable foundation for commerce rather than a source of systemic risk.

As Benston (1990) has argued in his comprehensive analysis of banking regulation, structural separation creates a more transparent and manageable financial system where specialized institutions can focus on their core functions without the distortions created by conflicts of interest. Commercial banks can return to their essential role of providing credit to businesses and households based on sound lending principles, while investment banks can facilitate capital formation through securities underwriting without endangering the broader banking system.

This separation also simplifies regulatory oversight, allowing supervisory agencies to develop specialized expertise appropriate to different types of financial institutions. The result will be more effective regulation that prevents excessive risk-taking while allowing legitimate financial innovation within appropriate institutional boundaries.

## Conclusion

The Glass-Steagall Act represents an essential structural reform that addresses the fundamental flaws in our banking system revealed by the Great Depression. By separating commercial and investment banking, establishing deposit insurance, and creating a comprehensive regulatory framework, this legislation will restore confidence in our financial system and prevent future economic catastrophes stemming from banking instability.

The lessons of our current crisis are clear: without structural safeguards, the financial system will periodically generate devastating crises that inflict enormous economic and social costs. The Glass-Steagall Act provides these essential safeguards, creating a resilient financial architecture that can withstand market fluctuations without threatening economic collapse. For the sake of current recovery and future stability, I urge the immediate implementation of this crucial legislation.
