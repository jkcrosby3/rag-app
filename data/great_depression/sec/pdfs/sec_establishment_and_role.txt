# The Securities and Exchange Commission: Restoring Market Integrity

## Historical Context
The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) was created as part of the sweeping financial reforms following the 1929 stock market crash and the subsequent Great Depression. Prior to the SEC's establishment, securities markets were largely unregulated at the federal level, allowing widespread fraud, market manipulation, and speculative excess.

## Legislative Foundation
- **Securities Act of 1933**: Often called the "Truth in Securities Act," it required companies offering securities to the public to disclose relevant financial information.
- **Securities Exchange Act of 1934**: Created the SEC as an independent regulatory agency to enforce securities laws, regulate securities markets, and protect investors.

## Core Principles and Objectives
1. **Investor Protection**: Safeguarding investors from fraud, manipulation, and deceptive practices
2. **Disclosure Requirements**: Ensuring companies provide accurate, timely, and comprehensive information
3. **Market Integrity**: Maintaining fair, orderly, and efficient markets
4. **Capital Formation**: Facilitating capital raising while protecting investors
