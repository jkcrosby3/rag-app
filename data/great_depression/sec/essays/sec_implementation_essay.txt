# Establishing the Securities and Exchange Commission: Restoring Market Integrity and Investor Confidence

## Introduction

The financial market collapse that triggered our current economic crisis has revealed dangerous gaps in market oversight that must be addressed through robust regulatory reform. The stock market crash of 1929 and subsequent revelations of widespread fraud, manipulation, and speculative excess have demonstrated the catastrophic consequences of unregulated securities markets. The proposed Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) represents an essential institution for restoring market integrity, rebuilding investor confidence, and preventing future financial catastrophes that threaten our entire economic system.

## The Regulatory Vacuum and Its Consequences

Prior to the 1929 crash, our securities markets operated with minimal federal oversight, creating conditions that enabled widespread abuse. The absence of standardized disclosure requirements allowed companies to sell securities without providing investors with accurate information about their financial condition. Market manipulation schemes, including pool operations and bear raids, distorted prices and undermined market integrity. Excessive margin lending fueled speculative bubbles that ultimately collapsed with devastating consequences for investors and the broader economy.

The consequences of this regulatory vacuum have been severe and far-reaching. Millions of Americans have lost their life savings in securities that proved worthless or were fundamentally misrepresented. The resulting crisis of confidence has paralyzed capital markets, preventing the flow of investment to productive enterprises. This capital market failure has contributed significantly to the economic contraction, unemployment, and business failures that characterize the Great Depression.

## The Foundation: The Securities Acts of 1933-34

The Securities Act of 1933 has begun addressing these issues through disclosure requirements for new securities offerings, establishing the principle that investors are entitled to accurate and comprehensive information before making investment decisions. However, as Seligman (2003) demonstrates in his comprehensive history of securities regulation, disclosure requirements alone are insufficient without institutional enforcement mechanisms and ongoing market oversight.

The Securities Exchange Act of 1934 builds on this foundation by extending regulation to securities exchanges, brokers, and dealers, and by creating the SEC as an independent regulatory agency to implement and enforce federal securities laws. This comprehensive approach recognizes that effective market regulation requires both clear rules and a dedicated institution with the authority and expertise to enforce them.

## Core Functions and Structure of the SEC

The proposed SEC would serve four critical functions essential to restoring and maintaining market integrity:

1. **Investor Protection**: Safeguarding investors from fraud, manipulation, and deceptive practices through enforcement actions and regulatory oversight.

2. **Disclosure Requirements**: Ensuring companies provide accurate, timely, and comprehensive information to investors through registration requirements and periodic reporting.

3. **Market Integrity**: Maintaining fair, orderly, and efficient markets through regulation of exchanges, broker-dealers, and trading practices.

4. **Capital Formation**: Facilitating legitimate capital raising while protecting investors through balanced regulatory approaches.

The SEC's organizational structure is designed to ensure both effectiveness and political independence. The five-commissioner structure with bipartisan requirements (no more than three commissioners from the same political party) will prevent regulatory capture and ensure balanced decision-making. The chairman, designated by the President, will provide leadership while specialized divisions will develop expertise in different aspects of securities regulation.

## Implementation Strategy

Implementing the SEC requires a phased approach that establishes core regulatory functions while building institutional capacity. The initial focus should be on establishing registration and disclosure systems for securities offerings and exchanges, developing market surveillance capabilities, and investigating the most egregious cases of fraud and manipulation.

As the institution develops, it can expand into more complex regulatory areas, including investment company oversight, accounting standards, and international coordination. This gradual approach allows for learning and adaptation while immediately addressing the most critical market failures.

The SEC will work in coordination with other financial regulators, including the Federal Reserve and banking agencies, to ensure comprehensive oversight of the financial system. This coordination is essential for addressing the interconnections between securities markets and other financial sectors that can transmit and amplify risks.

## Economic Benefits of Effective Securities Regulation

By implementing a comprehensive regulatory framework for securities markets, we can restore the investor confidence essential for economic recovery. As Mahoney (2003) demonstrates in his analysis of early securities regulation, effective oversight increases market participation by reducing information asymmetries and fraud risk. This increased participation will provide the capital necessary for business growth and job creation.

The economic benefits of the SEC will extend beyond the immediate restoration of market confidence. By ensuring accurate disclosure and preventing fraud, the SEC will improve capital allocation, directing investment to its most productive uses rather than to the most effectively marketed securities. This improved allocation efficiency will enhance economic growth and productivity over the long term.

Moreover, by reducing the frequency and severity of market crises, effective securities regulation will contribute to overall economic stability. The boom-bust cycles that have characterized securities markets in the absence of regulation impose enormous costs on the economy through misallocated resources, destroyed wealth, and damaged confidence. By moderating these cycles, the SEC will contribute to sustainable economic growth.

## Addressing Potential Concerns

Some may express concern that creating a new regulatory agency will impose costs on businesses and potentially constrain capital formation. These concerns, while understandable, fail to recognize that the greatest constraint on capital formation is the crisis of confidence created by unregulated markets. The SEC's balanced approach recognizes that effective markets require both freedom and accountability.

The SEC's disclosure-based regulation respects market mechanisms while ensuring that these mechanisms operate on the basis of accurate information. Rather than substituting regulatory judgment for market decisions, this approach enables investors to make informed choices while holding market participants accountable for fraud and manipulation.

## Conclusion

The SEC represents not a constraint on markets but a foundation for their proper functioning. By establishing this institution, we create the conditions for sustainable economic growth based on transparency, accountability, and investor protection. The lessons of the current crisis are clear: securities markets require effective oversight to prevent the abuses that undermine their essential function of capital allocation.

The establishment of the SEC will restore confidence in our capital markets, facilitate the flow of investment to productive enterprises, and prevent future market collapses that threaten economic stability. For these reasons, I urge the immediate implementation of this crucial regulatory reform as an essential component of our economic recovery strategy and a safeguard against future financial crises.
