# The Glass-Steagall Act (Banking Act of 1933): Historical Context and Impact

The Glass-Steagall Act, formally known as the Banking Act of 1933, separated commercial banking from investment banking activities and established the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) to protect bank deposits.

## Historical Context Leading to Glass-Steagall

### Banking Industry Transformation (1920s)
- United States emerged as world's leading economic power after World War I
- 1920s witnessed unprecedented prosperity
- Industrial production nearly doubled
- Per capita income rose by approximately 30%
- Banks increasingly engaged in speculative activities beyond traditional commercial banking

### Blending of Commercial and Investment Banking
- Prior to 1920s, most banks focused on accepting deposits and making loans
- During economic expansion, many banks established securities affiliates
- By 1930, commercial banks were underwriting approximately half of all new securities issues
- Created inherent conflicts of interest
- Banks had incentives to promote securities they underwrote to depositors

### Speculative Practices
- Banks increasingly directed depositors' funds toward speculative investments
- Extended loans to customers for stock purchases
- Purchased stocks often served as collateral ("buying on margin")
- Created precarious financial situation with artificially inflated stock values

### Banking Crisis (1930-1933)
- Stock market crash (October 1929) triggered collapse
- Banks with heavy stock investments suffered enormous losses
- Loans for stock purchases became uncollectible as collateral values plummeted
- Liquidity crisis forced banks to call in loans and sell assets at fire-sale prices
- Between 1930-1933, approximately 9,000 banks failed (nearly one-third of all U.S. banks)
- Millions of Americans lost their savings

### Banking System Collapse (Early 1933)
- Wave of bank failures triggered widespread panic
- By March 1933, banking systems in 38 states had closed or imposed withdrawal restrictions
- Roosevelt declared national "bank holiday" as first official act
- Temporarily closed all banks to prevent further runs and restore confidence

## Development and Passage of Glass-Steagall

### Key Architects
- Senator Carter Glass (Virginia): former Treasury Secretary who helped establish Federal Reserve
- Representative Henry Steagall (Alabama): chairman of House Banking and Currency Committee
- Glass advocated for separating commercial and investment banking
- Steagall championed federal deposit insurance

### Banking Act of 1933
- Signed into law by President Roosevelt on June 16, 1933
- Sections 16, 20, 21, and 32 established wall between commercial and investment banking
- Commercial banks prohibited from underwriting or dealing in securities (with limited exceptions)
- Investment banks barred from accepting deposits
- Banks given one year to decide whether to engage in commercial or investment banking

### Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC)
- Initially insured deposits up to $2,500 (later increased)
- Dramatically reduced risk of bank runs
- Funded by assessments on member banks
- Banking industry itself financed the insurance fund

### Additional Provisions
- Enhanced Federal Reserve's regulatory powers
- Imposed interest rate ceilings on deposits (Regulation Q)
- Prohibited banks from paying interest on demand deposits (checking accounts)
- Restricted interstate banking
- Aimed to create more stable, less competitive banking environment

## Impact and Legacy

### Immediate Impact
- Bank failures declined dramatically (from thousands annually to fewer than 100 per year by late 1930s)
- Public confidence in banking system restored
- Ended cycle of panic withdrawals
- Eliminated many conflicts of interest
- Reduced speculative activities by commercial banks

### Gradual Erosion and Repeal
- Wall between commercial and investment banking remained largely intact for over six decades
- Gradual erosion began in 1980s as regulators reinterpreted Act's provisions
- Final dismantling came with Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act of 1999
- Repealed core Glass-Steagall restrictions
- Allowed formation of financial holding companies engaging in commercial banking, investment banking, and insurance

### Broader Legacy
- Established principle that financial stability requires appropriate regulation
- Demonstrated government's willingness to intervene decisively in markets
- Influenced financial regulatory frameworks worldwide
- Many countries adopted similar structural reforms

### Contemporary Relevance
- 2008 financial crisis reignited debate about Glass-Steagall's wisdom
- Some argued its repeal contributed to crisis by allowing "too big to fail" financial conglomerates
- Encouraged excessive risk-taking
- Remains powerful symbol of regulatory response to financial crisis
