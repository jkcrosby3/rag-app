  "text": "Finally, the Act limits the activities of bank holding companies to banking and closely related activities, preventing the formation of complex financial structures designed to circumvent the separation of banking functions.\n## Implementation and Enforcement Framework\nEffective implementation of the Glass-Steagall Act requires a robust regulatory framework with clear lines of authority. The Act will be enforced by multiple regulatory agencies working in coordination:\n- The Federal Reserve Board will oversee the overall banking system and enforce key provisions\n- The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency will supervise national banks\n- The newly established FDIC will administer deposit insurance and monitor bank safety\n- The Securities and Exchange Commission (established in 1934) will regulate securities markets\nThis multi-agency approach provides comprehensive oversight while allowing specialized expertise in different aspects of financial regulation. The implementation process will include a reasonable transition period for banks to divest prohibited securities activities, minimizing market disruption while firmly establishing the new structural safeguards.\n## Long-term Benefits for Economic Stability\nImplementing the Glass-Steagall Act is not merely responding to past failures but proactively building a financial architecture that will support sustainable economic growth for generations to come. The stability this reform provides will ultimately benefit all sectors of the economy by ensuring that the banking system remains a reliable foundation for commerce rather than a source of systemic risk.\nAs Benston (1990) has argued in his comprehensive analysis of banking regulation, structural separation creates a more transparent and manageable financial system where specialized institutions can focus on their core functions without the distortions created by conflicts of interest. Commercial banks can return to their essential role of providing credit to businesses and households based on sound lending principles, while investment banks can facilitate capital formation through securities underwriting without endangering the broader banking system.\nThis separation also simplifies regulatory oversight, allowing supervisory agencies to develop specialized expertise appropriate to different types of financial institutions. The result will be more effective regulation that prevents excessive risk-taking while allowing legitimate financial innovation within appropriate institutional boundaries.\n## Conclusion\nThe Glass-Steagall Act represents an essential structural reform that addresses the fundamental flaws in our banking system revealed by the Great Depression. By separating commercial and investment banking, establishing deposit insurance, and creating a comprehensive regulatory framework, this legislation will restore confidence in our financial system and prevent future economic catastrophes stemming from banking instability.\nThe lessons of our current crisis are clear: without structural safeguards, the financial system will periodically generate devastating crises that inflict enormous economic and social costs. The Glass-Steagall Act provides these essential safeguards, creating a resilient financial architecture that can withstand market fluctuations without threatening economic collapse. For the sake of current recovery and future stability, I urge the immediate implementation of this crucial legislation.\n## References\nBenston, G. J. (1990).
