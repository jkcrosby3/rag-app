  "text": "The SEC represents not a constraint on markets but a foundation for their proper functioning. By establishing this institution, we create the conditions for sustainable economic growth based on transparency, accountability, and investor protection. The lessons of the current crisis are clear: securities markets require effective oversight to prevent the abuses that undermine their essential function of capital allocation.\nThe establishment of the SEC will restore confidence in our capital markets, facilitate the flow of investment to productive enterprises, and prevent future market collapses that threaten economic stability. For these reasons, I urge the immediate implementation of this crucial regulatory reform as an essential component of our economic recovery strategy and a safeguard against future financial crises.\n## References\nCoffee, J.
