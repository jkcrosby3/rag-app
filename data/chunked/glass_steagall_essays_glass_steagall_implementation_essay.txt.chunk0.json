  "text": "# Implementing the Glass-Steagall Act: A Firewall for Financial Stability\n## Introduction\nThe catastrophic financial collapse that precipitated the Great Depression has revealed fundamental flaws in our banking system that demand immediate structural reform. The collapse of nearly 9,000 banks between 1930 and 1933 has wiped out the savings of millions of Americans and paralyzed our economy. This unprecedented crisis demonstrates that allowing commercial banks to engage in speculative securities activities creates an inherently unstable financial system that jeopardizes our entire economic infrastructure. The proposed Glass-Steagall Act addresses these vulnerabilities by establishing a critical separation between commercial and investment banking activities—a separation that is not merely advisable but essential for preventing future economic disasters.\n## The Dangers of Combined Banking Functions\nThe evidence from our recent financial collapse clearly demonstrates the hazards of permitting commercial banks to engage in investment banking activities. When banks use depositors' funds for high-risk securities investments, they create a dangerous commingling of fundamentally different financial functions. As Kroszner and Rajan (1994) have documented in their comprehensive study of pre-Depression banking, this combination creates inherent conflicts of interest that undermine sound financial decision-making. Commercial bankers face irresistible temptations to underwrite unsound securities when they can profit from both the underwriting fees and the use of these securities to repay bank loans.\nMoreover, the speculative culture of investment banking inevitably infiltrates the traditionally conservative approach of commercial banking when both functions exist within the same institution. This cultural shift leads to excessive risk-taking with deposits that should be safeguarded for the stability of our payment system and the security of depositors' funds. The result, as we have witnessed, is a banking system prone to periodic crises that devastate not only the financial sector but the broader economy.\n## Key Provisions and Their Rationale\nThe Glass-Steagall Act addresses these structural vulnerabilities through several critical provisions. First and foremost, it prohibits commercial banks from engaging in investment activities, effectively separating these two distinct banking functions. This separation creates a firewall that prevents the contagion of risk from speculative securities activities to the commercial banking system that forms the backbone of our economy.\nSecond, the Act establishes the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) to provide deposit insurance, guaranteeing bank deposits up to a specified amount. This provision directly addresses the crisis of confidence that has led to destructive bank runs. By assuring depositors that their funds are secure regardless of an individual bank's condition, we can prevent the panic-driven withdrawals that have accelerated bank failures and deepened our economic crisis.\nThird, Regulation Q provisions prohibit banks from paying interest on demand deposits and authorize the Federal Reserve to set interest rate ceilings on time deposits. These measures discourage destructive competition for deposits that pushed banks toward increasingly risky investments to cover higher interest payments—a significant factor in the banking crisis.\nFinally, the Act limits the activities of bank holding companies to banking and closely related activities, preventing the formation of complex financial structures designed to circumvent the separation of banking functions. ## Implementation and Enforcement Framework Effective implementation of the Glass-Steagall Act requires a robust regulatory framework with clear lines",
